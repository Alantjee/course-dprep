# Data preparation and Workflow Management (dPrep)

**Engineer data sets from complex raw data and manage research projects efficiently**

_Tilburg University, Block 3, 2020/2021 (February - April 2021)_

_Instructor: [dr. Hannes Datta](https://hannesdatta.com)_


## Learn how to prepare data for empirical analysis

Welcome to the course website of dPrep. This course teaches you how to engineer data sets for statistical analysis. Many students and researchers perceive the process of “creating” a data set for analysis as rather simplistic: a bit of cleaning here, a bit of merging there, and you’re done. In this course, we take data preparation to the next level, by considering *highly complex data preparation workflows* (think multiple sources, structured and unstructured data, data from databases and data from files, multiple delivery batches, lots of missing data, different file versions, etc.). Throughout the course, we'll be using workflow principles of reproducible science that are documented at [Tilburg Science Hub](http://tilburgsciencehub.com).

## This website

This website is the backbone of the course, and features the following main sections.

- The __course__ section holds a list of weekly [modules](docs/course/modules), consisting of live streams, readings, and prerecorded clips. Even if you're not enrolled in this course, you can watch these clips, but interaction with the course instructor is reserved for enrolled students only.

- The [__tutorial__](docs/tutorials) section offers a workflow for collecting online data, and self-guided Jupyter Notebooks that teach the *basics* of data retrieval via web scraping and APIs. Use these to start your own scraping projects!

<!--- Finally, the [__building block__](docs/snippets) section offers a collection of code snippets in Python that you can use to build and extend your own scrapers and API retrieval projects.

Comments Roy:
- voorkennis eigenlijk verplicht

QUESTIONS SUSAN:
- dprep eerst laten lopen, dan pas web scraping
- niveau toetsen met python; entry exam ("encore")
- voorgangstoets

- duidelijk maken dat het geen peer review is!


- no need to prep each and every "deep" level
