# About

When we worked on our first empirical research project about a decade ago, we honestly didn't have a clue on how to manage data-intensive research projects. Over the years, we found out how cumbersome it could be to be good at stats, but bad at automizing and documenting our work.

We've built up expertise in data preparation and workflow management. And we're eager to pass it on to you - even if you're not enrolled in our class.

Feedback is appreciated always.
