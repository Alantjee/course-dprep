<!--
o	Pursue to hand in a high-quality code (e.g., have a clear structure, annotate it using Markdown cells, try to formulate every command well, and make sure it contributes to the actual outcome – your parsed data). Aim to make your script free of mistakes, so that it directly runs on our computers, too. Use efficient error handlings (i.e., don’t wrap everything in a big try/except), and name your input and output files. We have made available coding tips on http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tips/coding/.
o	We invite you to share snippets of your parsing scripts via Gists on GitHub with other teams. You can post URLs to these Gists for others to view/use/reuse on Canvas.
