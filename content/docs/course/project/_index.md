# Team Project

## Motivation

Plan and execute a data preparation workflow. This is where things get together.

After completion of the project, students and researchers need to be equipped with the practical skills to manage the data preparation for a complex project themselves.

Students work in groups. PhD or RM students who take the course can work on their actual research project, if the data is available.

1. Research question stage
- explore raw data using R
- starting prepping some data a little bit, trying to understand things
- pipeline drafting in a lecture/interactive lecture
- voor scriptie te kunnen gebruiken

2. The workflow stage
- Initialize repository structure ("input, output, transformation") + project pipelines; NO automation
- Decide where to put raw data, and read it in; reassure that pipeline stages are self-contained (only prep)
- Think about workflow: cleaning for each raw data; then merging
- Commit your code throughout
- CHECKPOINT: does your repos replicate and do what it's supposed to do?!

3. Analysis & deployment stage
- generating PDF, making an APP, [...]
