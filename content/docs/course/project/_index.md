# Team Project

## Motivation

Throughout the course, we have touched upon various phases of the data preparation and workflow management pipeline. In the team project, we bring together all that you have learnt.

Together with your team members, you will
- build a data preparation and analyis pipeline from scratch, and
- submit your entire end-to-end workflow via a GitHub repository.

Working on your team project is not only a great refresher on the course content, but *especially* gives you a better sense of the added value of
- using Git/GitHub when collaborating with one another, and
- automation with `make` with a many source code files.

In addition, the building blocks provide code snippets for more advanced functionalities you may want to incorporate in your team project.

## Learning Goals

After completion of the project, students and researchers need to be equipped with the practical skills to manage the data preparation for a complex, data-intensive research project independently.

## Teams

- Students work in groups
  - 4-5 students per team
  - Allocation during class hours
  - We recommend teams to have agreed upon the overall project idea prior to the start of the project in week 6, so that you can start right away.
- (External) PhD and research master students auditing this course can work on their own research projects.

## Planning

The team project runs in weeks 6-8. <!-- In weeks 6-8, you will work on a team project. Since the timeline is relatively short, we recommend you to stick to the schedule below. Each of the Input, Transformation, Output (ITO) phases corresponds with the template file of the [sample project](sample_project).-->

| Week | Stage | Phase |
|:---- | :---- | :---- |
| 6 | Data Preparation & Version Control | Input & Transformation |
| 7 |  Automation & Data Exploration | Input & Transformation |
| 8 |  Deployment & Reporting  | Output  |

You can sign up for an optional team meeting with the course instructor in weeks 6-8 to gather feedback on your project. Details on how to register for a timeslot will be provided to you at a later stage.
