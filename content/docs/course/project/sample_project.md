# Sample Project

Plan and execute a data preparation workflow. This is where things get together.


## Input
- explore raw data using R
- starting prepping some data a little bit, trying to understand things
- pipeline drafting in a lecture/interactive lecture
- Directory Structure


## Transformation
- Initialize repository structure ("input, output, transformation") + project pipelines; NO automation
- Decide where to put raw data, and read it in; reassure that pipeline stages are self-contained (only prep)
- Think about workflow: cleaning for each raw data; then merging
- Commit your code throughout
- CHECKPOINT: does your repos replicate and do what it's supposed to do?!


## Output
- generating PDF, making an APP, [...]
