# FAQ for Documentation

To document your data collection, please start from the [template](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/workflow/documenting-data/).

## Tips for filling in the documentation
-	Try to answer the questions to the best of your ability.
    - Imagine you would have to work with this data in the future – how would you write up the documentation so that you (and your future self) may understand it?
    - In your writing, be as concise as possible. We’ve had some recent experience using tools like Grammarly to improve our writing (there is a free version available), but there are certainly alternatives available!
    - The original paper on which the readme template is based on provides a few helpful (filled in) examples that may provide some inspiration.
- We recommend you to use a proper text editor (e.g., ATOM) to work on your readme.
    - Good text editors will also indicate to you where new lines should occur (to make sure that the text stays readable).
- Next to the .txt, please convert the readme to a PDF file, which we can easily use to grade your readmes on Canvas.

## Specific guidance for each section
1. __Name of the dataset/database__:
Please pick a good name for your dataset. This name will be the first thing potential users of your data will see.

2. __Section 1 (Motivation):__
In motivating your data collection, please bear in mind the data should be suitable to use in an academic research project.

3. __Section 2 (Composition):__
To answer some of the questions in this section, you need to explore the data you have collected. Some questions can also be (more accurately) answered by writing a small script. However, doing so is optional and should be attempted by those students that wish to be challenged (i.e., already engage with material that will be taught at a later moment in this course).

4. __Section 3 (Collection process):__
Please answer all questions.

5. __Section 4 (Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling):__ Please skip this section, but leave the unanswered questions in the document.

6. __Section 5 (Uses):__
Please answer all questions.

7. __Section 6 (Distribution) and section 7 (Maintenance):__ Please skip these sections, but leave them unanswered in the document.
