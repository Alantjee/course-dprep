__Running out of memory?__  
Older machines may face difficulties storing large datsets into memory. Fortunately, you can make use of cloud environments like Kaggle to "outsource" the processing tasks for you. On Kaggle you can create a so-called notebook which has similar functionalities such as the popular Jupyter Notebooks (that you may have used in oDCM) with the important difference that the execution of the script occurs in the cloud rather than on your local machine. Therefore, computer hardware never have to be a limiting factor anymore. 

Sign up for a [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login), visit the "Code" tab, and click on "New Notebook". By default, it opens a Python notebook but in the right sidebar you can change the settings to R (only R scripts are supported; no markdown files). Note that you first need to upload your datasets to Kaggle before you can use them (click "Add data" button in the top right). Take note of the file path of your datasets: `../input/{DATASET-TITLE}/{DATASET-NAME}.csv` which may be somewhat different than you're used to in RStudio.
