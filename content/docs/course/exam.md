* Make use of the cheatsheets!

<!-- POST-COVID

* Downloading files (C:\users\[your username]) versus Jupyter’s default startup directory (c:\users\default) – practice that!

* Websites blocked, except [jsonviewer.stack.hu](jsonviewer.stack.hu)

* Be there about 15 minutes earlier to start up your computer

* Find programs via the start menu – do not install Jupyter or any package yourself
