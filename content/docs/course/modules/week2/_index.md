# Week 2: Data availability and research fit

## Meetup

- Exploration of research and business ideas *live* <!-- add zoom link-->
<!-- post link here
Discussion: Structuring potential research and business ideas

<!--

- Generate groups on the fly: academic versus business; API vs. web scraping; substantive areas in which you're interested; initial research ideas

- Create break-out groups: 20-30m of discussion
- Leading questions:
  - What's hot right now?
  - What are important phenomena?
  - What excites you about research?
  - Which websites do you spend a lot of time on?
  - What websites would be cool to monitor today?
  - Have you used an API before?
  - Have you stumbled upon some interesting documentation?

  - What excites you?
  - Search for websites: what do they show?
  - Search for APIs: what do they show? Are they accessible?
  - Why is it an important phenomena, whom does it affect?

- Come back in the "big room" + quick presentation + feedback

- The result is a board with websites, and people that are interested in it
- Subscribe to at least 3 data sources.

- Together with other team members, fill in the "steckbrief" of these sites

<!--[split by academic research/ topic, vs. business): generating ideas for potential data sources / phenomena ("what's hot right now? What are important phenomena?", "what excites you about a potential area? what would be cool websites to monitor today?"

- Discuss: in which area does it fall? are people monitoring that site already? what capture would you hope to achieve? is this more "investment in data?"/"timeliness", or more robustness? is this more a covariate or a key thing?

- breakout groups: academia/business
- presentation to the entire group
- generate list of websites and APIs, and allocation to teams (4-5 students)
