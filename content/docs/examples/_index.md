# Examples and extra material

This site collects links to web scrapers and API retrieval projects.

## Web scrapers
- Great websites to start your first scraping project
  - [Boxofficemojo](https://boxofficemojo.com) is well structured and has stats on movie revenue, release date, and actors
  - [Sports Reference](https://www.sports-reference.com) has stats on players in US sports (baseball, basketball, football, hockey)
  - [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com) is also locally available, but keep your maximum retrieval frequency at 1 page per second.
- More advanced use cases
  - Ever tried extracting data from data widgets (e.g., like available at The New York Times)?
  - [Netflix Home Screen Capture](https://github.com/hannesdatta/data-netflix)
