An overview of the most important Git commands: 

## Code 

Makes a clone of the repository at the specified URL (never clone a repository into another repository!)

```

---

Adds changes to the specified file to the staging area to be committed

```
git add <file_name>
```

---

Commits staged changes and allows you to write a commit message
```
git commit -m <your_message>
```

---

Pushes local changes to the specified branch of the online repository
```
git push origin <branch_name>
```

* This [tutorial](../../../tutorials/version-control/version-control.html) walks you through how to step-by-step create a Github repository and push changes to it.
* `git add .` adds all changes to the staging area to be committed (without having you to mention all files separately).
* You can create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your repository to tell Git to stop paying attention to files you donâ€™t care about. For example, the following file will ignore any file within the my_passwords folder, as well as any csv-files (even if you call `git add .`)!
```
my_passwords/*
*.csv
```
