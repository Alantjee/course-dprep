2. Web scraping 101
  - Applications: spotifcharts.com (headless; download CSV), socialblade.com (selenium; simulated browser)

    - Understand the implications of using various user agents in request headers
    - Save content of HTTP request to a file, and explore content (and compare content to one that you see in a browser)
    - Learn about the structure of websites using Chrome's developer tools, and identify elements using "anchors" (e.g., CSS selectors, XPATHs)
    - Extract values (e.g., text, attributes) from web site elements as identified by their CSS selectors
    - Write extracted values to flat txt/csv files
    - Load IDs of seeds from external txt/csv files
    - Modularize code, by using functions and loops
    - Handle retrieval errors using try and except statements
    - Make use of timers to emulate user behavior (e.g., `time.sleep(1)`)

## Principles/points of discussion

- Ideally, notebooks themselves present *usuable* marketing cases already
- Tutorials
  - ...
- cases and examples [Case ideas for marketers; extend, put student examples here?]
  - scrape prices
  - collect buienradar data
  - collect social media
  - collect reviews data
  - collect twitter data
  - deploy dashboard
  - automate emails
  - collect from Twitter
  - ...other examples?
  - "big picture" cases
- The tutorials should pick up some of the concepts from the workflow
- Challenge is to build both concepts and skills, and to learn about the basic concepts of scraping
