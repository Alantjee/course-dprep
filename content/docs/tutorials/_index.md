# Tutorials and Data Challenges

Learn the technical skills required to work on data-intensive research projects. Most tutorials start with existing content (e.g., from [Datacamp](https://datacamp.com), [TheTuringWay](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/), or [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com)). Each tutorial also consists of a Data Challenge, which apply the learnt concepts in the domain of marketing analytics.
