Whooping cough is a real and present danger to your infant and that you have only one unambiguous way to protect your son from it, which is requiring everyone to have a whooping cough vaccine.

Remind him that it's not a two-sided debate, and he will not find a pediatrician that would take his side. In the world.

Tell him, ultimately, it's his personal decision whether he wants to get a vaccine or not, but the one who actually has choices in this situation is him and _not_ you, who obviously has a greater priority to protect their infant son over the feelings of a grandparent."

* [**00:03:50**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=3m50s) \- *Question*. Can you discuss in further detail why you recommend a water-only fast versus consuming coffee or amino acids while in a fasted state? I am looking to optimize my morning workouts with amino acids or a caffeine boost and want to know what benefits I am potentially missing out on versus the benefits I likely still receive.
* [**00:12:30**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=12m30s) \- *Question*. First of all, thanks for all that you do! You have changed my life. Is there any more evidence yet surrounding if having coffee, tea, supplements, etc. while fasting disrupts the benefits of fasting? What about electrolytes?
* [**00:14:43**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=14m43s) \- *Question*. Has there been evidence that one method of fasting is better than others?
* [**00:24:04**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=24m04s) \- *Question*. Will consumption of exogenous ketones disrupt a fasting state?
* [**00:29:30**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=29m30s) \- *Question*. I practice a simple 12-hour eating window and a 24 hour fast once a week. My question is, are there any downsides to training fasted as I usually do? The exercises involved are heavy weight training and moderate cardio afterwards. Just wanted to know if I’m metabolically doing harm or having adverse effects on the intended goals. Thanks and much love to your work.
* [**00:34:31**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=34m31s) \- *Question*. Can you elaborate on the growth-longevity trade off? By fasting we down-regulate the aging pathways such as mTOR, growth hormone, and IGF1, but in order to build muscle through resistance training we need to eat protein and have these pathways activated in order to maintain/build muscle. Is there a way we can get the best of both worlds? Is this trade-off overstated? How so? Thank you!
* [**00:43:55**](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/zero-fasting-qa?t=43m55s) \- *Question*. The ideal way to break a fast; is there a method to the madness with macro timing as it pertains to glycogen levels, or is it fine to eat anything in particular once you reach your eating window?

FTA:
&gt; In other words, starvation can lead to a differential stress resistance (DSR) between normal and cancer cells. According to the DSR hypothesis, normal cells respond to starvation by downregulating proliferation-associated and ribosome biogenesis and/or assembly genes, which forces cells to enter a self-maintenance mode and shields them from the damage caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other toxic agents. By contrast, in cancer cells, this self-maintenance mode is prevented through oncogenic changes, which cause constitutive inhibition of stress response pathways."

dpatrick86;t1;1509551056.0;r/Nootropics;2017-11-01;15:44;"Definitely /u/rperciav. I help her run the podcast out of familial obligation hehe. 

It is a lot of work, but it's rewarding. We're looking to start doing these timelines for all episodes, including older ones... and I'd like to get this level of detail with the studies linked as often as possible. As a bonus, we also had this podcast transcribed and put the captions on YouTube, which makes it accessible to the hearing-impaired, etc. I'm pretty excited about the new improvements. All made possible by the almost fanatical support we've been receiving from listeners."
dpatrick86;t1;1509550838.0;r/intermittentfasting;2017-11-01;15:40;"She's talking about time-restricted eating and not multi-day fasts there. It's probably not as big of a deal as people make it out to be, but it's not like she pulled it out of thin air. See [01:09:52](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m52s). Most people when they're setting goals with IF aren't thinking about tissue-specific circadian oscillations, which is the purpose of avoiding xenohormetics outside of the fasting window. The polyphenols and caffeine in coffee require metabolism by the liver, so in that sense, you've started putting a digestive organ to work by drinking black coffee.

Now, whether that's offset by having a really small eating windows (e.g. 8 hours) or has a negligible affect on rate of fat loss... totally different question, but at least from the perspective of metabolism, it is sub-optimal."

* [01:27:16](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h27m16s) - Animal studies of time-restricted feeding show improvements in lean muscle mass in mice restricted to a feeding window of 8 to 9 hours, but this wasn't observed in the group receiving the ""unhealthy diet."" This increase in lean muscle mass was also associated with an increase in a transcriptional coactivator that functions as the _master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis_ known as PGC-1alpha. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547).
* [01:30:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h30m06s) - **Practical implementation**: Should we avoid brushing our teeth or using mouthwash outside of the eating window?

* [01:40:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h40m06s) - Transcription factors controlling the enzymes that degrade xenobiotics, such as cytochrome P450s, are strongly circadian and even used as _reporters_ in circadian studies. This has practical implications like the fact that pharmaceutical drugs may be more effective depending on the time of day that they are administered. [Study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.1160/full).
* [01:42:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h42m36s) - Nearly 70% of FDA approved drugs have their intended targets cycling in accordance with a circadian rhythm. This suggests that better drug timing may be of great relevance to medicine in the near future.

* [00:40:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h40m56s) - **Relevant for shift workers**: animal studies suggest that eating within a time window is superior to ad libitum feeding, even when the timing of that eating window is less than ideal (e.g. later in the day or evening).
* [00:42:49](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h42m49s) - Early caloric restriction studies, due to the incidental constraints of experiment design and lab resources, actually followed a pattern that _share some qualities of shift work and time-restricted feeding_: rodents were fed when they would usually be sleeping (in the mornings) and consumed all of their food within 2-3 hours instead of at random throughout the entire day.
* [00:44:34](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h44m34s) - Animal evidence for shift workers suggest that a combination of caloric restriction, a healthy diet, and eating in a time window are probably all the current best options for mitigating deleterious effects.
* [00:45:31](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h45m31s) - **On delaying the eating window**: starting the eating window earlier in the day is thought to be beneficial due to enhanced insulin sensitivity earlier in the day. Dr. Panda gives his thoughts on how to setup your own n=1 experiment using just a glucometer.
* [00:47:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h47m48s) - Melatonin, which begins to rise, on average, 2-3 hours before our habitual sleep time, [binds to receptors in the pancreas to tell it to stop producing insulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19377888). That means eating within this window of time (just before bed) can result in higher blood glucose as we rest, _which is another potential problem with a later eating window_.
* [00:49:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h49m10s) - This relationship between insulin and melatonin was initially unearthed by the observation made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that some people with certain polymorphisms in melatonin had a greater risk of diabetes and obesity. Melatonin receptors in the pancreas turned out to be this missing link. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057517/).
* [00:50:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m06s) - **Opinion**: An eight hour window starting at noon is still much better than random eating over a greater than 12 hour window.
* [00:50:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m51s) - When healthy adults eat meals that are identical in terms of both their macronutrient and caloric content at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the postprandial glucose increase is lowest after breakfast and highest after dinner even though the meals were 100% identical. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9331550/).
* [00:51:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m18s) - Dr. Panda introduces the concept of ""evening diabetes"": some people can show a healthy fasting blood glucose in the mornings, but then defy expectations by showing very poor response to a post-prandial glucose test in the evenings.
* [00:51:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m56s) - Differentiating between the various types of fasting.
* [00:52:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h52m59s) - Somatic and qualitative sensations that help define the boundaries between types of fasting: early feelings of lightness, eventual headache (24+ hours).
* [00:53:41](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h53m41s) - Formation of a certain threshold of circulating _ketone bodies_ may also be a useful milestone (this transition may sometimes be accompanied by a headache).
* [00:54:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h54m47s) - The three foundations of health that inform the Panda group's lifestyle guidelines: sleep, nutritional food &amp; physical activity.
* [00:55:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h55m58s) - The difference between time-restricted eating and prolonged fasting is that time-restricted eating is fundamentally one of simple daily maintenance. _It represents a bare minimum that is not too dissimilar from brushing your teeth_.
* [00:56:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m26s) - Dr. Panda likens a prolonged water fast of 4-5 days to being more like a regular trip to the dentist. _Anecdotally, Satchin does this type of long fast once per year._ [Article about his personal fasting habits and those of others in the field](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/49462/title/Running-on-Empty/).
* [00:56:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m50s) - An important distinction between time-restricted eating is that it can be a lifestyle that is usable by anyone, whereas prolonged fasting is not accessible to all populations and may require medical supervision.
* [00:58:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h58m57s) - Liver glycogen begins to deplete at 10 hours and adipose tissue begins to release fatty acids and production of ketone bodies begins to ramp up. [Study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276016000618).
* [00:59:14](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m14s) - Rhonda mentions cytosolic protein deacetylation, which is in an important autophagy signal. [Learn more deep biology of autophagy in this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm626MgpveI).
* [00:59:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m48s) - By ignoring circadian rhythm, many labs that have done work looking at fasting and caloric restriction may assume valid data to be artifact or noise. This has probably lead research groups to gravitate towards researching the effects of longer fasting protocols where the _signal is stronger_.
* [01:01:17](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h01m17s) - In contrast, the Panda group asks questions _like_ whether or not ketone bodies rise reproducibly everyday around the same time... and then proceed to test this with a time course over a series of set intervals (e.g. every hour). After confirming that this does happen to a small degree, they then begin to ask the question of whether or not there might be some important but subtle tissue-specific benefits to this type of biological rhythm or, conversely, consequences to its disruption.
* [01:02:54](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h02m54s) - Autophagy gene expression oscillates on a 24-hour pattern and disruption of circadian clock genes has a direct effect on this autophagy activity.  During the fasting phase this gene expression is activated in the liver. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897364).
* [01:04:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h04m50s) - The effect of circadian disruption on the ability to tolerate DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and how hair follicles, one of the most rapidly dividing cells, may resist cancer by being especially good at repair thanks to its strong circadian rhythm. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:06:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h06m26s) - **Radiation tolerance and repair**: mice receiving a dose of radiation in the morning lose much more hair than if they'd been administered the dose in the evening (only 15% loss at 8PM vs. 85% loss from an 8AM dose). _Interestingly, this dose of radiation is similar to what may be used clinically in radiation treatment._ [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:07:46](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h07m46s) - **Recovery from surgery**: in mouse studies, improved recovery from a partial hepatectomy (resection of the liver) is also associated with an evening surgery. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042339).
* [01:08:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h08m47s) - Time-restricted feeding reduces tumor growth in mice. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15219806/).
* [01:09:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m08s) - Breast cancer patients that practice time-restricted eating by fasting for 13-hours overnight had a 36% reduced incidence of breast cancer recurrence. [Study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2506710). [Interview with this study's author Dr. Ruth Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qlrB84xp5g).
* [01:09:52](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m52s) - **Time-restricted feeding and coffee**: the somewhat definitive answer on whether or not we should drink coffee outside of our fasting window and why the time-restricted feeding guidelines have this distinction from the popular 16:8 intermittent fast protocols. [myCircadianClock caffeine article](http://blog.mycircadianclock.org/caffeine/). **Relevant studies**: [1](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/305/305ra146), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21352949)."

# Timeline
* [00:00:00](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h00m00s) - Brief recap of the broad discussion from the [first conversation Rhonda had with Dr. Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU).
* [00:01:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h01m35s) - Some of the animal evidence of the effects of maintaining a 9-12 hour eating window, which includes: effects on glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, favorable changes in lean muscle mass, and gene expression.
* [00:02:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h02m51s) - American Heart Association meta-analysis concluded limiting the number of hours of eating during the day or maintaining overnight fasting (e.g. time-restricted feeding) was beneficial for maintaining cardiovascular health. [Study](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/01/30/CIR.0000000000000476).
* [00:04:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h04m36s) -  Adopting a time-restricted feeding paradigm (by not eating later than 5, 6, or 7 PM) often results in an incidental reduction of caloric intake, which, while not a goal of time-restricted feeding, may actually be helpful for those with metabolic syndrome and obesity.
* [00:05:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h05m58s) - Rodent models for metabolic syndrome, when subjected to a conservative time-restricted feeding regimen, generally don’t become _lean_, however, their blood biomarkers (*glucose*, *cholesterol*, *triglycerides*) regress back to an almost normal range _even in the context of a low-quality diet_.
* [00:07:28](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h07m28s) - Explanation for how time-restricted feeding actually relates to our circadian rhythm and Dr. Panda’s qualitative description of “health.” **Note**: _thinking from the paradigm of circadian rhythm is actually an important distinction between Dr. Panda’s work on time-restricted feeding and conventional intermittent fasting protocols._
* [00:08:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h08m51s) - 10-14 hours of fasting when we get up in the morning means that we have given our gut “rest” because it has a period of not processing food. Moreover, having 3-4 hours of fasting before bed can help with sleep in the evening.
* [00:10:19](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h10m19s) - _Ad libitum_ feeding, when compared to a calorically and nutritionally identical but time-constrained feeding pattern of 8 to 10 hours (depending on the trial), reveals that time-restricted feeding is a consistently healthier pattern, according to animal research.
* [00:11:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h11m35s) - Time-restricted eating is easy to implement because most of us are already used to having to synchronize some of our daily activities to the clock. **For example**: when we wake or when we get to work or leave our place of employment.
* [00:12:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m18s) - Sometimes Dr. Panda’s group has to adjust the eating window by a half hour or an hour (from 8 to 9-hours of feeding per day, for example) in order to ensure that the time-restricted group still consumes the same calories, but small changes like this has a mostly negligible effect on the benefits.
* [00:12:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m50s) - **Dr. Panda’s group has tested the concept of cheat weekends**: In experiments where mice are allowed ad libitum eating times (usually eating over 12 hours per day) but only on the weekend, mice still experienced benefits from time-restricted eating.
* [00:13:33](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h13m33s) - Dr. Panda discusses his time-restricted feeding schedule, which starts at around 7 or 8 in the morning and ends around 5 or 6 in the evening.
* [00:14:12](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h14m12s) - **Anecdote**: eating a diet that is low in high glycemic index foods and simple sugars and higher in fiber and/or slightly higher in protein is associated with less hunger when eating in a time-restricted fashion.
* [00:17:20](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h17m20s) - After ~5 weeks of habituation to time-restricted feeding, users participating in the [myCircadianClock trial](http://www.myCircadianClock.org) via the mobile app tend to report that cheating gives them what might be colloquially referred to as a “food hangover.”
* [00:18:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h18m51s) - Dr. Panda explains some of the benefit to the distributed mobile app trial design he employs through [myCircadianClock.org](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/): it’s naturally more inclusive design that has a greater degree of geographic diversity than even the most well-funded conventional trials… and also includes _shift workers_, which would often be excluded from clinical trials.
* [00:22:03](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m03s) - Feedback from mobile app trial participants actually sometimes lead to novel questions entering into animal trial design. User reports relief from immune-related disease → new focus of inquiry for animal research → reductions in systemic inflammation as a mechanistic explanation.
* [00:22:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m59s) - Observations surrounding effects of time-restricted feeding on inflammatory bowel disease is one unique example of this “closed loop” pattern of scientific inquiry (animal → human feedback → back to animal for mechanism) is a unique opportunity the Panda group has due to their ability to solicit direct user feedback from participants of their [mobile app trial](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/).
* [00:25:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h25m10s) - Discussing the effect of time-restricted feeding [on systemic inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547).
* [00:26:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m08s) - Time-restricted feeding as an opportunity for night-time repair that may prevent gut leakiness (or ""gut permeability""), which is an important source of systemic inflammation.
* [00:26:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m58s) - Timing of macronutrients that may differentially affect gut permeability.
* [00:28:09](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m09s) - The gut lining as one of the most important interfaces in which our interact with the environment, which emerging evidence is showing to be governed by circadian clocks from the oesophagus to the cecum, including the gut microbiome.
* [00:28:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m57s) - Time-restricted feeding promotes the [rhythmic changes in gut microbiota populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470548) that are supposed to occur throughout the day, increasing healthy diversity.
* [00:30:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h30m36s) - Shift workers are a population that seem to be predisposed to gut-related issues and this may make them especially well-suited to a time-restricted feeding intervention.
* [00:31:07](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h31m07s) - **Potential implications for acid reflux**: animal research has shown that time-restricted feeding has an affect on the proton pump responsible for the acidification of the stomach, reducing its expression in the gut. _This proton pump is also the target of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of acid reflux._
* [00:34:02](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h34m02s) - Uber and Lyft drivers are often a type of shift work that may not be classified as such. Similarly, the [family members of shift workers also adopt a lifestyle that unintentionally takes on characteristics of shift work as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338776/). Dr. Panda's group refers to this second order effect as *secondhand hand shift workers*. Using these broader definitions of shift work, Dr. Panda estimates upwards of 30% to 40% of the population may have shift work for at least a few months or years over the course of their lives.

* [01:40:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h40m06s) - Transcription factors controlling the enzymes that degrade xenobiotics, such as cytochrome P450s, are strongly circadian and even used as _reporters_ in circadian studies. This has practical implications like the fact that pharmaceutical drugs may be more effective depending on the time of day that they are administered. [Study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.1160/full).

* [00:40:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h40m56s) - **Relevant for shift workers**: animal studies suggest that eating within a time window is superior to ad libitum feeding, even when the timing of that eating window is less than ideal (e.g. later in the day or evening).
* [00:42:49](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h42m49s) - Early caloric restriction studies, due to the incidental constraints of experiment design and lab resources, actually followed a pattern that _share some qualities of shift work and time-restricted feeding_: rodents were fed when they would usually be sleeping (in the mornings) and consumed all of their food within 2-3 hours instead of at random throughout the entire day.
* [00:44:34](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h44m34s) - Animal evidence for shift workers suggest that a combination of caloric restriction, a healthy diet, and eating in a time window are probably all the current best options for mitigating deleterious effects.
* [00:45:31](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h45m31s) - **On delaying the eating window**: starting the eating window earlier in the day is thought to be beneficial due to enhanced insulin sensitivity earlier in the day. Dr. Panda gives his thoughts on how to setup your own n=1 experiment using just a glucometer.
* [00:47:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h47m48s) - Melatonin, which begins to rise, on average, 2-3 hours before our habitual sleep time, [binds to receptors in the pancreas to tell it to stop producing insulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19377888). That means eating within this window of time (just before bed) can result in higher blood glucose as we rest, _which is another potential problem with a later eating window_.
* [00:49:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h49m10s) - This relationship between insulin and melatonin was initially unearthed by the observation made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that some people with certain polymorphisms in melatonin had a greater risk of diabetes and obesity. Melatonin receptors in the pancreas turned out to be this missing link. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057517/).
* [00:50:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m06s) - **Opinion**: An eight hour window starting at noon is still much better than random eating over a greater than 12 hour window.
* [00:50:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m51s) - When healthy adults eat meals that are identical in terms of both their macronutrient and caloric content at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the postprandial glucose increase is lowest after breakfast and highest after dinner even though the meals were 100% identical. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9331550/).
* [00:51:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m18s) - Dr. Panda introduces the concept of ""evening diabetes"": some people can show a healthy fasting blood glucose in the mornings, but then defy expectations by showing very poor response to a post-prandial glucose test in the evenings.
* [00:51:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m56s) - Differentiating between the various types of fasting.
* [00:52:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h52m59s) - Somatic and qualitative sensations that help define the boundaries between types of fasting: early feelings of lightness, eventual headache (24+ hours).
* [00:53:41](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h53m41s) - Formation of a certain threshold of circulating _ketone bodies_ may also be a useful milestone (this transition may sometimes be accompanied by a headache).
* [00:54:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h54m47s) - The three foundations of health that inform the Panda group's lifestyle guidelines: sleep, nutritional food &amp; physical activity.
* [00:55:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h55m58s) - The difference between time-restricted eating and prolonged fasting is that time-restricted eating is fundamentally one of simple daily maintenance. _It represents a bare minimum that is not too dissimilar from brushing your teeth_.
* [00:56:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m26s) - Dr. Panda likens a prolonged water fast of 4-5 days to being more like a regular trip to the dentist. _Anecdotally, Satchin does this type of long fast once per year._ [Article about his personal fasting habits and those of others in the field](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/49462/title/Running-on-Empty/).
* [00:56:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m50s) - An important distinction between time-restricted eating is that it can be a lifestyle that is usable by anyone, whereas prolonged fasting is not accessible to all populations and may require medical supervision.
* [00:58:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h58m57s) - Liver glycogen begins to deplete at 10 hours and adipose tissue begins to release fatty acids and production of ketone bodies begins to ramp up. [Study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276016000618).
* [00:59:14](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m14s) - Rhonda mentions cytosolic protein deacetylation, which is in an important autophagy signal. [Learn more deep biology of autophagy in this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm626MgpveI).
* [00:59:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m48s) - By ignoring circadian rhythm, many labs that have done work looking at fasting and caloric restriction may assume valid data to be artifact or noise. This has probably lead research groups to gravitate towards researching the effects of longer fasting protocols where the _signal is stronger_.
* [01:01:17](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h01m17s) - In contrast, the Panda group asks questions _like_ whether or not ketone bodies rise reproducibly everyday around the same time... and then proceed to test this with a time course over a series of set intervals (e.g. every hour). After confirming that this does happen to a small degree, they then begin to ask the question of whether or not there might be some important but subtle tissue-specific benefits to this type of biological rhythm or, conversely, consequences to its disruption.
* [01:02:54](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h02m54s) - Autophagy gene expression oscillates on a 24-hour pattern and disruption of circadian clock genes has a direct effect on this autophagy activity.  During the fasting phase this gene expression is activated in the liver. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897364).
* [01:04:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h04m50s) - The effect of circadian disruption on the ability to tolerate DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and how hair follicles, one of the most rapidly dividing cells, may resist cancer by being especially good at repair thanks to its strong circadian rhythm. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:06:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h06m26s) - **Radiation tolerance and repair**: mice receiving a dose of radiation in the morning lose much more hair than if they'd been administered the dose in the evening (only 15% loss at 8PM vs. 85% loss from an 8AM dose). _Interestingly, this dose of radiation is similar to what may be used clinically in radiation treatment._ [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:07:46](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h07m46s) - **Recovery from surgery**: in mouse studies, improved recovery from a partial hepatectomy (resection of the liver) is also associated with an evening surgery. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042339).
* [01:08:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h08m47s) - Time-restricted feeding reduces tumor growth in mice. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15219806/).
* [01:09:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m08s) - Breast cancer patients that practice time-restricted eating by fasting for 13-hours overnight had a 36% reduced incidence of breast cancer recurrence. [Study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2506710). [Interview with this study's author Dr. Ruth Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qlrB84xp5g).
* [01:09:52](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m52s) - **Time-restricted feeding and coffee**: the somewhat definitive answer on whether or not we should drink coffee outside of our fasting window and why the time-restricted feeding guidelines have this distinction from the popular 16:8 intermittent fast protocols. [myCircadianClock caffeine article](http://blog.mycircadianclock.org/caffeine/). **Relevant studies**: [1](http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/305/305ra146), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21352949)."

# Timeline
* [00:00:00](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h00m00s) - Brief recap of the broad discussion from the [first conversation Rhonda had with Dr. Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU).
* [00:01:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h01m35s) - Some of the animal evidence of the effects of maintaining a 9-12 hour eating window, which includes: effects on glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, favorable changes in lean muscle mass, and gene expression.
* [00:02:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h02m51s) - American Heart Association meta-analysis concluded limiting the number of hours of eating during the day or maintaining overnight fasting (e.g. time-restricted feeding) was beneficial for maintaining cardiovascular health. [Study](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/01/30/CIR.0000000000000476).
* [00:04:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h04m36s) -  Adopting a time-restricted feeding paradigm (by not eating later than 5, 6, or 7 PM) often results in an incidental reduction of caloric intake, which, while not a goal of time-restricted feeding, may actually be helpful for those with metabolic syndrome and obesity.
* [00:05:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h05m58s) - Rodent models for metabolic syndrome, when subjected to a conservative time-restricted feeding regimen, generally don’t become _lean_, however, their blood biomarkers (*glucose*, *cholesterol*, *triglycerides*) regress back to an almost normal range _even in the context of a low-quality diet_.
* [00:07:28](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h07m28s) - Explanation for how time-restricted feeding actually relates to our circadian rhythm and Dr. Panda’s qualitative description of “health.” **Note**: _thinking from the paradigm of circadian rhythm is actually an important distinction between Dr. Panda’s work on time-restricted feeding and conventional intermittent fasting protocols._
* [00:08:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h08m51s) - 10-14 hours of fasting when we get up in the morning means that we have given our gut “rest” because it has a period of not processing food. Moreover, having 3-4 hours of fasting before bed can help with sleep in the evening.
* [00:10:19](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h10m19s) - _Ad libitum_ feeding, when compared to a calorically and nutritionally identical but time-constrained feeding pattern of 8 to 10 hours (depending on the trial), reveals that time-restricted feeding is a consistently healthier pattern, according to animal research.
* [00:11:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h11m35s) - Time-restricted eating is easy to implement because most of us are already used to having to synchronize some of our daily activities to the clock. **For example**: when we wake or when we get to work or leave our place of employment.
* [00:12:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m18s) - Sometimes Dr. Panda’s group has to adjust the eating window by a half hour or an hour (from 8 to 9-hours of feeding per day, for example) in order to ensure that the time-restricted group still consumes the same calories, but small changes like this has a mostly negligible effect on the benefits.
* [00:12:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m50s) - **Dr. Panda’s group has tested the concept of cheat weekends**: In experiments where mice are allowed ad libitum eating times (usually eating over 12 hours per day) but only on the weekend, mice still experienced benefits from time-restricted eating.
* [00:13:33](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h13m33s) - Dr. Panda discusses his time-restricted feeding schedule, which starts at around 7 or 8 in the morning and ends around 5 or 6 in the evening.
* [00:14:12](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h14m12s) - **Anecdote**: eating a diet that is low in high glycemic index foods and simple sugars and higher in fiber and/or slightly higher in protein is associated with less hunger when eating in a time-restricted fashion.
* [00:17:20](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h17m20s) - After ~5 weeks of habituation to time-restricted feeding, users participating in the [myCircadianClock trial](http://www.myCircadianClock.org) via the mobile app tend to report that cheating gives them what might be colloquially referred to as a “food hangover.”
* [00:18:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h18m51s) - Dr. Panda explains some of the benefit to the distributed mobile app trial design he employs through [myCircadianClock.org](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/): it’s naturally more inclusive design that has a greater degree of geographic diversity than even the most well-funded conventional trials… and also includes _shift workers_, which would often be excluded from clinical trials.
* [00:22:03](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m03s) - Feedback from mobile app trial participants actually sometimes lead to novel questions entering into animal trial design. User reports relief from immune-related disease → new focus of inquiry for animal research → reductions in systemic inflammation as a mechanistic explanation.
* [00:22:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m59s) - Observations surrounding effects of time-restricted feeding on inflammatory bowel disease is one unique example of this “closed loop” pattern of scientific inquiry (animal → human feedback → back to animal for mechanism) is a unique opportunity the Panda group has due to their ability to solicit direct user feedback from participants of their [mobile app trial](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/).
* [00:25:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h25m10s) - Discussing the effect of time-restricted feeding [on systemic inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547).
* [00:26:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m08s) - Time-restricted feeding as an opportunity for night-time repair that may prevent gut leakiness (or ""gut permeability""), which is an important source of systemic inflammation.
* [00:26:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m58s) - Timing of macronutrients that may differentially affect gut permeability.
* [00:28:09](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m09s) - The gut lining as one of the most important interfaces in which our interact with the environment, which emerging evidence is showing to be governed by circadian clocks from the oesophagus to the cecum, including the gut microbiome.
* [00:28:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m57s) - Time-restricted feeding promotes the [rhythmic changes in gut microbiota populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470548) that are supposed to occur throughout the day, increasing healthy diversity.
* [00:30:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h30m36s) - Shift workers are a population that seem to be predisposed to gut-related issues and this may make them especially well-suited to a time-restricted feeding intervention.
* [00:31:07](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h31m07s) - **Potential implications for acid reflux**: animal research has shown that time-restricted feeding has an affect on the proton pump responsible for the acidification of the stomach, reducing its expression in the gut. _This proton pump is also the target of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of acid reflux._
* [00:34:02](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h34m02s) - Uber and Lyft drivers are often a type of shift work that may not be classified as such. Similarly, the [family members of shift workers also adopt a lifestyle that unintentionally takes on characteristics of shift work as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338776/). Dr. Panda's group refers to this second order effect as *secondhand hand shift workers*. Using these broader definitions of shift work, Dr. Panda estimates upwards of 30% to 40% of the population may have shift work for at least a few months or years over the course of their lives.

* [00:40:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h40m56s) - **Relevant for shift workers**: animal studies suggest that eating within a time window is superior to ad libitum feeding, even when the timing of that eating window is less than ideal (e.g. later in the day or evening).
* [00:42:49](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h42m49s) - Early caloric restriction studies, due to the incidental constraints of experiment design and lab resources, actually followed a pattern that _share some qualities of shift work and time-restricted feeding_: rodents were fed when they would usually be sleeping (in the mornings) and consumed all of their food within 2-3 hours instead of at random throughout the entire day.
* [00:44:34](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h44m34s) - Animal evidence for shift workers suggest that a combination of caloric restriction, a healthy diet, and eating in a time window are probably all the current best options for mitigating deleterious effects.
* [00:45:31](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h45m31s) - **On delaying the eating window**: starting the eating window earlier in the day is thought to be beneficial due to enhanced insulin sensitivity earlier in the day. Dr. Panda gives his thoughts on how to setup your own n=1 experiment using just a glucometer.
* [00:47:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h47m48s) - Melatonin, which begins to rise, on average, 2-3 hours before our habitual sleep time, [binds to receptors in the pancreas to tell it to stop producing insulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19377888). That means eating within this window of time (just before bed) can result in higher blood glucose as we rest, _which is another potential problem with a later eating window_.
* [00:49:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h49m10s) - This relationship between insulin and melatonin was initially unearthed by the observation made by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that some people with certain polymorphisms in melatonin had a greater risk of diabetes and obesity. Melatonin receptors in the pancreas turned out to be this missing link. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057517/).
* [00:50:06](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m06s) - **Opinion**: An eight hour window starting at noon is still much better than random eating over a greater than 12 hour window.
* [00:50:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h50m51s) - When healthy adults eat meals that are identical in terms of both their macronutrient and caloric content at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the postprandial glucose increase is lowest after breakfast and highest after dinner even though the meals were 100% identical. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9331550/).
* [00:51:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m18s) - Dr. Panda introduces the concept of ""evening diabetes"": some people can show a healthy fasting blood glucose in the mornings, but then defy expectations by showing very poor response to a post-prandial glucose test in the evenings.
* [00:51:56](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h51m56s) - Differentiating between the various types of fasting.
* [00:52:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h52m59s) - Somatic and qualitative sensations that help define the boundaries between types of fasting: early feelings of lightness, eventual headache (24+ hours).
* [00:53:41](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h53m41s) - Formation of a certain threshold of circulating _ketone bodies_ may also be a useful milestone (this transition may sometimes be accompanied by a headache).
* [00:54:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h54m47s) - The three foundations of health that inform the Panda group's lifestyle guidelines: sleep, nutritional food &amp; physical activity.
* [00:55:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h55m58s) - The difference between time-restricted eating and prolonged fasting is that time-restricted eating is fundamentally one of simple daily maintenance. _It represents a bare minimum that is not too dissimilar from brushing your teeth_.
* [00:56:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m26s) - Dr. Panda likens a prolonged water fast of 4-5 days to being more like a regular trip to the dentist. _Anecdotally, Satchin does this type of long fast once per year._ [Article about his personal fasting habits and those of others in the field](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/49462/title/Running-on-Empty/).
* [00:56:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h56m50s) - An important distinction between time-restricted eating is that it can be a lifestyle that is usable by anyone, whereas prolonged fasting is not accessible to all populations and may require medical supervision.
* [00:58:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h58m57s) - Liver glycogen begins to deplete at 10 hours and adipose tissue begins to release fatty acids and production of ketone bodies begins to ramp up. [Study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276016000618).
* [00:59:14](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m14s) - Rhonda mentions cytosolic protein deacetylation, which is in an important autophagy signal. [Learn more deep biology of autophagy in this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm626MgpveI).
* [00:59:48](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h59m48s) - By ignoring circadian rhythm, many labs that have done work looking at fasting and caloric restriction may assume valid data to be artifact or noise. This has probably lead research groups to gravitate towards researching the effects of longer fasting protocols where the _signal is stronger_.
* [01:01:17](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h01m17s) - In contrast, the Panda group asks questions _like_ whether or not ketone bodies rise reproducibly everyday around the same time... and then proceed to test this with a time course over a series of set intervals (e.g. every hour). After confirming that this does happen to a small degree, they then begin to ask the question of whether or not there might be some important but subtle tissue-specific benefits to this type of biological rhythm or, conversely, consequences to its disruption.
* [01:02:54](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h02m54s) - Autophagy gene expression oscillates on a 24-hour pattern and disruption of circadian clock genes has a direct effect on this autophagy activity.  During the fasting phase this gene expression is activated in the liver. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21897364).
* [01:04:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h04m50s) - The effect of circadian disruption on the ability to tolerate DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) radiation and how hair follicles, one of the most rapidly dividing cells, may resist cancer by being especially good at repair thanks to its strong circadian rhythm. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:06:26](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h06m26s) - **Radiation tolerance and repair**: mice receiving a dose of radiation in the morning lose much more hair than if they'd been administered the dose in the evening (only 15% loss at 8PM vs. 85% loss from an 8AM dose). _Interestingly, this dose of radiation is similar to what may be used clinically in radiation treatment._ [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690597).
* [01:07:46](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h07m46s) - **Recovery from surgery**: in mouse studies, improved recovery from a partial hepatectomy (resection of the liver) is also associated with an evening surgery. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042339).
* [01:08:47](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h08m47s) - Time-restricted feeding reduces tumor growth in mice. [Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15219806/).
* [01:09:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=01h09m08s) - Breast cancer patients that practice time-restricted eating by fasting for 13-hours overnight had a 36% reduced incidence of breast cancer recurrence. [Study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2506710). [Interview with this study's author Dr. Ruth Patterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qlrB84xp5g).

# Timeline
* [00:00:00](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h00m00s) - Brief recap of the broad discussion from the [first conversation Rhonda had with Dr. Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU).
* [00:01:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h01m35s) - Some of the animal evidence of the effects of maintaining a 9-12 hour eating window, which includes: effects on glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, favorable changes in lean muscle mass, and gene expression.
* [00:02:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h02m51s) - American Heart Association meta-analysis concluded limiting the number of hours of eating during the day or maintaining overnight fasting (e.g. time-restricted feeding) was beneficial for maintaining cardiovascular health. [Study](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/01/30/CIR.0000000000000476).
* [00:04:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h04m36s) -  Adopting a time-restricted feeding paradigm (by not eating later than 5, 6, or 7 PM) often results in an incidental reduction of caloric intake, which, while not a goal of time-restricted feeding, may actually be helpful for those with metabolic syndrome and obesity.
* [00:05:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h05m58s) - Rodent models for metabolic syndrome, when subjected to a conservative time-restricted feeding regimen, generally don’t become _lean_, however, their blood biomarkers (*glucose*, *cholesterol*, *triglycerides*) regress back to an almost normal range _even in the context of a low-quality diet_.
* [00:07:28](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h07m28s) - Explanation for how time-restricted feeding actually relates to our circadian rhythm and Dr. Panda’s qualitative description of “health.” **Note**: _thinking from the paradigm of circadian rhythm is actually an important distinction between Dr. Panda’s work on time-restricted feeding and conventional intermittent fasting protocols._
* [00:08:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h08m51s) - 10-14 hours of fasting when we get up in the morning means that we have given our gut “rest” because it has a period of not processing food. Moreover, having 3-4 hours of fasting before bed can help with sleep in the evening.
* [00:10:19](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h10m19s) - _Ad libitum_ feeding, when compared to a calorically and nutritionally identical but time-constrained feeding pattern of 8 to 10 hours (depending on the trial), reveals that time-restricted feeding is a consistently healthier pattern, according to animal research.
* [00:11:35](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h11m35s) - Time-restricted eating is easy to implement because most of us are already used to having to synchronize some of our daily activities to the clock. **For example**: when we wake or when we get to work or leave our place of employment.
* [00:12:18](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m18s) - Sometimes Dr. Panda’s group has to adjust the eating window by a half hour or an hour (from 8 to 9-hours of feeding per day, for example) in order to ensure that the time-restricted group still consumes the same calories, but small changes like this has a mostly negligible effect on the benefits.
* [00:12:50](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h12m50s) - **Dr. Panda’s group has tested the concept of cheat weekends**: In experiments where mice are allowed ad libitum eating times (usually eating over 12 hours per day) but only on the weekend, mice still experienced benefits from time-restricted eating.
* [00:13:33](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h13m33s) - Dr. Panda discusses his time-restricted feeding schedule, which starts at around 7 or 8 in the morning and ends around 5 or 6 in the evening.
* [00:14:12](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h14m12s) - **Anecdote**: eating a diet that is low in high glycemic index foods and simple sugars and higher in fiber and/or slightly higher in protein is associated with less hunger when eating in a time-restricted fashion.
* [00:17:20](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h17m20s) - After ~5 weeks of habituation to time-restricted feeding, users participating in the [myCircadianClock trial](http://www.myCircadianClock.org) via the mobile app tend to report that cheating gives them what might be colloquially referred to as a “food hangover.”
* [00:18:51](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h18m51s) - Dr. Panda explains some of the benefit to the distributed mobile app trial design he employs through [myCircadianClock.org](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/): it’s naturally more inclusive design that has a greater degree of geographic diversity than even the most well-funded conventional trials… and also includes _shift workers_, which would often be excluded from clinical trials.
* [00:22:03](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m03s) - Feedback from mobile app trial participants actually sometimes lead to novel questions entering into animal trial design. User reports relief from immune-related disease → new focus of inquiry for animal research → reductions in systemic inflammation as a mechanistic explanation.
* [00:22:59](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h22m59s) - Observations surrounding effects of time-restricted feeding on inflammatory bowel disease is one unique example of this “closed loop” pattern of scientific inquiry (animal → human feedback → back to animal for mechanism) is a unique opportunity the Panda group has due to their ability to solicit direct user feedback from participants of their [mobile app trial](http://www.mycircadianclock.org/).
* [00:25:10](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h25m10s) - Discussing the effect of time-restricted feeding [on systemic inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547).
* [00:26:08](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m08s) - Time-restricted feeding as an opportunity for night-time repair that may prevent gut leakiness (or ""gut permeability""), which is an important source of systemic inflammation.
* [00:26:58](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h26m58s) - Timing of macronutrients that may differentially affect gut permeability.
* [00:28:09](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m09s) - The gut lining as one of the most important interfaces in which our interact with the environment, which emerging evidence is showing to be governed by circadian clocks from the oesophagus to the cecum, including the gut microbiome.
* [00:28:57](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h28m57s) - Time-restricted feeding promotes the [rhythmic changes in gut microbiota populations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470548) that are supposed to occur throughout the day, increasing healthy diversity.
* [00:30:36](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h30m36s) - Shift workers are a population that seem to be predisposed to gut-related issues and this may make them especially well-suited to a time-restricted feeding intervention.
* [00:31:07](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/satchin-round-2?t=00h31m07s) - **Potential implications for acid reflux**: animal research has shown that time-restricted feeding has an affect on the proton pump responsible for the acidification of the stomach, reducing its expression in the gut. _This proton pump is also the target of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of acid reflux._

Similarly, the [family members of shift workers also adopt a lifestyle that unintentionally takes on characteristics of shift work as well](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5338776/). Dr. Panda's group refers to this second order effect as *secondhand hand shift workers*. Using these broader definitions of shift work, Dr. Panda estimates upwards of 30% to 40% of the population may have shift work for at least a few months or years over the course of their lives.

dpatrick86;t1;1504834997.0;r/science;2017-09-08;01:43;"Sure. I was alluding to the work of Dr. Satchin Panda, a biologist focusing particularly on circadian biology. Dr. Panda's work, in particular, focuses on the benefits (animal &amp; clinical research) of constraining eating to a time window of 8-12 hours per day but otherwise eating the same calories. The larger window doesn't actually seem that bad, right? Apparently, however, most people eat in a larger, 15-hour window.

The problem with that is that, while our ""master regulator"" of circadian rhythm, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN for short) is set by light... other circadian rhythms known as peripheral oscillations are triggered by things like physical activity (e.g. muscle) and, more importantly in this context, digestion (e.g. liver).

This mismatch between our master circadian rhythm and these tissue-specific rhythms can have subtle and somewhat insidious effects on our health, but one of the interesting observations is that eating in a smaller time window seems to improve sleep quality.

I'm summarizing broadly from his presentations rather than from actual familiarity with the primary literature (otherwise I'd be giving your citations), but he's the real deal doing fascinating translational research in high impact journals.

Here's a great discussion covering his work...

The scientist's work to which she is referring to is that of [Dr. Satchin Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R-eqJDQ2nU). He's been studying and publishing academically on a style of eating known as time-restricted eating, which emphasizes a circadian-style of eating. 

Autophagy may occur in shorter intervals, but the best evidence for it is in longer interval fasting. With time-restricted eating, however, the goal is to simply leave a certain time window each day, usually beginning in the early evening, in which you do not consume anything that kicks off unnecessary metabolic activity. That point of difference is important to realize because it means we're not even necessarily talking about xenobiotics in the context of a diet that might be thought to strongly induce autophagy in the first place.

Since even a zero-calorie beverage still involves the activity of liver enzymes, this is excluded during non-eating hours (whatever you decide those may be). Nowhere, so far as I know,  is the connection made that by consuming non-caloric xenobiotics outside your eating window are you: stopping weight loss from fasting **or** stopping autophagy from happening if it was going to happen anyway."

The data presented in their paper was actually very interesting.

Fasting one day per month may be beneficial for other or even similar reasons, but this period of fasting is intended to mimic the effects of ""prolonged fasting"" which involves a particularly robust increase in autophagy where entire organs even lose mass and then experience subsequent renewal during the re-feed period. It's pretty intense stuff.

dpatrick86;t1;1482947875.0;r/fasting;2016-12-28;17:57;I'm not the author. Dr. Panda's work shows specific benefits for specific time intervals. You're right, that if you want to conform to an extremely aggressive eating window (breakfast and lunch only), you probably don't need an app. If you want to conform to a very specific interval and don't always eat at the same times, it probably helps to time it.
dpatrick86;t1;1482870823.0;r/fasting;2016-12-27;20:33;"Multi-day fasts are a little less complex. It's a bit more binary, right? 

On another note: you might also consider trying the reverse pattern. You're less insulin sensitive later at night and some of the work that's come out of the Salk Institute (Dr. Satchin Panda's lab) suggests that having periods of deprivation is only part of the picture... the other part is eating in accordance with your circadian clock. In other words: earlier, when you're more insulin sensitive."

Here's just a few of the more salient points of the podcast...

* Dom's efforts at teasing out the differences between induced nutritional ketosis (through a low carbohydrate, high fat diet) and ketosis from the dietary introduction of exogenous ketones, like beta-hydroxybutyrate, especially in the context of therapeutic and performance enhancing effects.

* His work on formulating ketone esters.

* The differences in tolerability between MCT (medium chain triglycerides) powders versus liquids, as well as the amount of supplemental MCT a person would need to consume in order to achieve mild ketosis without carbohydrate restriction.

* The differences between different types of ketogenic diets.

* The modified atkins diet which has been demonstrated to have similar efficacy to the classical ketogenic diet in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and how it may be a slightly more practical option for achieving therapeutic nutritional ketosis.

* The importance of making the correct carbohydrate choices, even and maybe especially in the context of a ketogenic diet, with a diverse variety of raw vegetables being the most favorable.

* What keto adaptation is and what it means, at a physiological level, to be keto adapted and how this is distinguished from short periods of ketosis we experience in our day-to-day lives.

* Some of Dom's ideas around cycling various dietary strategies as a way of promoting metabolic flexibility.

* How ketones, when used as a source of energy, may result in a net reduction in the number of damaging reactive byproducts known as reactive oxygen species than what may be produced by other forms of energy metabolism while also producing more ATP from, proportionately, the same amount of oxygen."

In this case, however, rs7946 is inconsistent. The study mentioning the ""A"" alleles at the top (PMID 16051693) would have to be referencing the other strand.

Specifically, his lab developed a technique to use the human placenta as a robust source of stem cells that have a similar sort of potential as embryonic stem cells and show the capacity to differentiate into a wide variety of cell types (like neurons, muscle, lung, kidney, liver, blood or immune c
ells). 


His name is [Dr. Frans Kuypers](http://www.chori.org/Principal_Investigators/Kuypers_Frans_A/kuypers_overview.html), and one of the things they talk about is the exciting possibility that this source of stem cells may pave the way to some sort of widespread public banking system that may take advantage of these abundant early-stage stem cells present in placenta, and leverage them for powerful new therapies that (as we all know) seem to be growing in number by the day.


Great quote that pretty much summarizes the take-home from their conversation on the subject of placental stem cells (which is usually thrown away with the placenta after birth)...

* **[00:00:00](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h00m00s)** - Pre-podcast intro. Briefly contextualizes forthcoming conversation by explaining importance of [Dr. Kuypers](http://www.chori.org/Principal_Investigators/Kuypers_Frans_A/kuypers_overview.html)' lab's findings, importance of both the pluripotent cells (which can differentiate widely) and the [hematopoietic stem cells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell).
* **[00:01:55](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h01m55s)** - Cut to actual podcast reel with Dr. Kuypers in the frame.
* **[00:02:43](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h02m43s)** - Dialogue begins about paper that came out of Dr. Kuypers lab entitled: ""[Human term placenta as a source of hematopoietic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429852)""
* **[00:03:31](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h03m31s)** - ""Yes, the stem cells are there; yes, they are viable; and yes, we can get them out""
* **[00:03:39](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h03m39s)** - [Sickle-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle-cell_disease) and [thalassemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassemia) (areas of Dr. Kuypers research) are genetic blood disorders that can only be cured *with stem cells*. Dr. Kuypers work on these disorders ultimately lead to his lab's discovery of the placenta as a source for hematopoietic stem cells. These cells are directly useful for these disorders and are 5-7 fold more abundant in placenta than in cord blood, which is an established source of stem cells used therapeautically in [bone marrow transplant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation#Bone_marrow).
* **[00:05:21](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h05m21s)** - On embryonic stem cells: ""All of us starts with one cell and that makes... *us*"".
* **[00:06:35](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h06m35s)** - On the placenta as a more ethical source of pluripotent stem cells: ""In contrast to embryonic stem cells there is no ethical issue at all.""
* **[00:07:42](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h07m42s)** - ""If you take about one microliter of cord blood it has about 4 million cells in it.""
* **[00:08:20](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h08m20s)** - Comparing the abundance of stem cells in cord blood versus placenta: cord blood per birth ~100 milliliters (3.4 oz) relative to ~1 kg (2.2 lbs) of placental tissue that is discarded.
* **[00:09:24](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h09m24s)** - ""The whole argument is don't throw your placenta out, let's see where we can use it.""
* **[00:09:34](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h09m34s)** - Discussion of 2012 paper (""[Multipotent stromal cells from human placenta demonstrate high therapeutic potential](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3635148/)"") which demonstrated pluripotency of the placenta stem cells. In other words, their ability to differentiate into any cell in the human body.
* **[00:11:07](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h11m07s)** - On the promise of public banking of abundant pluripotent placental stem cells: ""You can then create cell lines or cell resources that can not only become anything, but also that can have the genetic background so that it can fit whoever needs it.""
* **[00:11:21](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h11m21s)** - ""There are two options here: either you're born and you keep your placenta (somehow) for use when you're eighty years old or whatever... or... you have enough placenta stored in placenta banks and they can find one that will fit for you.""
* **[00:12:03](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h12m03s)** - On commercial availability of Dr. Kuypers (et al) techniques.
* **[00:16:10](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h16m10s)** - Therapeautic applications.
* **[00:16:59](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h16m59s)** - On number of live births in the U.S. per year: ""That's almost 4 million placentas... in the trash.""
* **[00:17:25](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h17m25s)** - ""Hundreds of kids have been cured with the use of cord blood. So, yes, those stem cells which form new blood (because it replaces your bone marrow) have been used and have been very successful.""
* **[00:18:50](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h18m50s)** - [Graft-versus-host disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graft-versus-host_disease).
* **[00:21:02](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h21m02s)** - ""In the next decades, what we will see is that these pluripotent stem cells will now become a tool in the toolbox of a physician to repair whatever needs to be repaired. It's not happening tomorrow. Part of it is already in place, like bone marrow transplants. Part of it may already work to help to repair burn victims. So there are all kind of things that are currently already happening that are really going into that direction. These pluripotent or multipotent stem cells really are the future of tissue repair.""
* **[00:21:55](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h21m55s)** - Begin dialogue surrounding [induced pluripotent stem cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell) (turning already differentiated cells, like skin cells, into stem cells).

* **[00:29:04](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h29m04s)** - ""Obviously where we are now is completely different from where we were ten years ago.""
* **[00:30:13](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h30m13s)** - ""Yes, we have a resource that nature provides us... use it. That is essentially what I am trying to say.""
* **[00:32:53](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h32m53s)** - On using a *biogenerator* to leverage the capacity for young cells to produce growth factors and other chemicals that benefit the larger community of older cells: ""Cells are never living by themselves. They live in a community. It's like a village. [...] That means that cells talk to each other. [...] That means that not only are the cells important, but it is also the chemicals they spit out.""
* **[00:35:35](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h35m35s)** - More on using a *biogenerator*, this time in the context of pediatric liver transplant: ""It's not necessarily that you have to replace those cells, but maybe the cells that you have can help to generate an environment that [will enable that liver] to grow better. So, in other words, it's a much more complex story than just talking about a cell replacing cell... it is also thinking about a cell population that talks to other guys and generates chemicals [such as] growth factors, and cytokines.""
* **[00:36:10](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h36m10s)** - On growth factors and cytokines from stem cells: ""These chemicals help tissue to regenerate. So that means regenerative medicine is more than just replacing cells.""
* **[00:36:40](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h36m40s)** - [On Amy Wagers et al. paper on GDF11](http://hsci.harvard.edu/news/functioning-aged-brains-and-muscles-mice-made-younger): ""They found that when they transfer blood from young mice into old mice, something happens that allows them to regenerate liver, heart [cells]... it was a growth factor.""
* **[00:39:10](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h39m10s)** - ""So my argument is: don't try to reinvent the wheel. Use the cells to let them make what other cells tell them to make and use it.""
* **[00:41:36](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h41m36s)** - Around 250 to 350 public and private cord blood banks around the world. Dr. Kuypers talks about the possibility and promise of them adopting his lab's techniques to similarly use placenta instead of just cord blood.
* **[00:43:50](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h43m50s)** - ""There will be people that think that from a public health point-of-view it makes sense to store it.""

* **[00:45:12](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h45m12s)** - On storing placental stem cells and the need for institutional or business partnerships needed to bring widespread storage to the public: ""We have currently the ability to do it. In other words, if I were to get now a placenta tomorrow. I could take the placenta, use my technology, put it into liquid nitrogen, and store it. But doing that costs money.""
* **[00:46:45](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h46m45s)** - On [PlaSalus](http://www.plasalus.com): ""What we do as a company is provide the technology that allows you to deal with the placenta in the ways that we talked about. We provide the knowledge, and the know-how.""
* **[00:50:53](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h50m53s)** - ""Thousands of people die every year because they do not have a proper resource for their bone marrow transplant or whatever they need. And so this means that those people, if they would have that resource would not die.""
* **[00:54:41](http://youtu.be/XrK5_pEUzdI?t=00h54m41s)** - ""In the United States we are not the best at funding research in general. [...] The problem with that is that new ideas [...] do not get developed in the way they should (currently), because new ideas do not get developed in the way that they should as a society. The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov), as an example, has been retracting over time continuously.""

* [01:54:45](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=01h54m45s) - Mixed tocopherol Vitamin E supplements exist which aren't quite as high dose as 10x the RDA (400 IU) like used in those studies.
* [02:01:18](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h01m18s) - RDA for Vitamin D is 600 IU a day. One study showed that 4,000 IU was more appropriate for actually adequately fixing without toxicity in deficient populations. 2000 to 4000 IU is probably a good range except for in cases of severe deficiency.
* [02:03:18](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h03m18s) - Offitt lumped omega-3 in with ""antioxidants that cause cancer"", but this is misleading given the fact that randomized controlled trials have shown that omega-3 *supplementation* actually reduces all-cause mortality.
* [02:03:39](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h03m39s) - 1500 IU a day has been correlated to a 17% reduced cancer risk (overall)
* [02:04:15](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h04m15s) - Study based off of self-reported questionaire found that women who took vitamins (supplements) - on a daily basis had the longest telomeres
* [02:05:45](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h05m45s) - She tries to get all her micronutrients, as much as she can, from her diet including vegetable smoothies, fish, etc. However, in addition to her diet she takes: omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin d, a multi-vitamin which has selenium and other trace elements, iodine, b-complex.
* [02:06:30](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h06m30s) - B vitamin deficiency is less common due to fortification. However, she supplements B vitamins anyway because changes in mitochondrial membrane rigidity that occurs with age alters the binding affinity (as represented by the constant kM) of important proteins needed to generate energy in the form of ATP which are embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. The Ames lab has partly demonstrated, however, that increasing the concentration of B vitamins compensates for these age related changes caused by changes in the confirmation (shape) of the proteins.
* [02:08:00](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h08m00s) - Increasingly pefers Swanson brand vitamins, but gets omega-3 from nordic naturals
* [02:10:00](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h10m00s) - B vitamins are probably less dangerous because they're water soluble (&amp; excess is more readily excreted, similar to Vitamin C)
* [02:11:00](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h11m00s) - Plant form of omega-3, ALA, converts to EPA (normally found in fish) fairly inefficiently at a rate of about 5%.
* [02:12:13](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h12m13s) - Microalgae oil might be a nice alternative to flaxseed oil if you're trying to meet EPA/DHA needs and avoiding fish oil for one reason or another.
* [02:13:30](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h13m30s) - Omega-3 EPA is a potent anti-inflammatory, and DHA is a really component of your cell membranes -- and makes up about 40% of the brain.
* [02:13:54](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h13m54s) - She takes about 6 pills of her omega-3, which amounts to ~3 ""servings"" of 800mg of EPA, and 600mg of DHA. (2400 and 1800 mg respectively)
* [02:15:28](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h15m28s) - Omega-3 EPA, which can be bought more concentrated for its particular effects, interacts with the archnidonic acid pathway to reduce inflammation. The archnicdonic acid pathway is responsible for creating prostaglandins which activate the COX pathway.
* [02:16:05](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h16m05s) - 2 grams of EPA per day has been shown to reduce C-Reactive Protein, which is a generalized systemic marker for inflammation but is most well known for its use to asses risk of cardiovascular disease.
* [02:17:45](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h17m45s) - Omega-3 fats are prone to oxidation. Refrigeration helps with this, however. Also check if they go rancid and/or smell bad.
* [02:20:00](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h20m00s) - Talks about krill oil. Joe lists off a bunch of points from a mercola article, and Rhonda points out it's talking about ordinary effects of omega-3 and falsely suggesting they're unique to krill oil.
* [02:27:29](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h27m29s) - Recommends Linus Pauling Institute for good, objective supplemental vitamin reviews
* [02:28:35](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h28m35s) - Brief mention of WellnessFX as a useful tool for getting a broad spectrum blood test checking for relevant markers for vitamins, minerals, inflammation, etc.
* [02:31:00](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h31m00s) - Whackiness of homepathy discussed. Homeopathy makes use of official sounding measuring system that measures an absurd amount of dilution that actually guarantees that what you're taking doesn't actually include the active ingredient the supplement is being marketed for.
* [02:33:25](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h33m25s) - Discusses how emerging research showing wisdom teeth's dental pulp stem cells offer promise for eventually being used as a source of cells that can be differentiated into things like brain cells. You can bank children's teeth or adult wisdom teeth. Usually like $625 to ""process"" a tooth, and around $125/year to store it.
* [02:36:16](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h36m16s) - They can now take fibroblast cells from skin, the sort that you slough off everyday, and add transcription factors to turn them into ""pluripotent"" stem cells which can turn into brain cells or liver cells.
* [02:37:35](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h37m35s) - Joe brings up study where they took blood of young mice, injected it into old mice, and found the older mice experienced tissue regeneration. Inverse was also true: injecting young mice with old mouse blood increased rate of aging.
* [02:38:54](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h38m54s) - Human ""methylome"" now being studied which is revealing a specific pattern of methylation in DNA that can be used to actually identify the chronological age of people. Since epigenetics is obviously playing an important role in age, this is another promising area of new inquiry that may eventually reveal how to reprogram our cells to ""be younger"". Cancer cells show a methylation pattern that is ordinarily associated with old age and are clustered around areas related to DNA repair, mitochondrial metabolism, antioxidant genes (all areas associated with aging).
* [02:43:12](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h43m12s) - Scientists are now able to take renal cells excreted in urine and turn them into pluripotent stem cells
* [02:43:45](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h43m45s) - Rant about lack of funding in science reducing room for creativity/moonshots
* [02:48:40](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h48m40s) - Joe brings up new studies showing its possible to create artificial blood for transplant
* [02:50:06](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h50m06s) - Inactivating insulin growth factor in c. elegans worms doubles their lifespan from about 15 to 30 days.
* [02:52:40](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h52m40s) - Joe asserts (reasonably so) that by age 200 he will most *likely* be a wizard.
* [02:55:42](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h55m42s) - Joe relates the fact that hes actually been evacuated twice due to large fires in his neck of the woods of L.A.
* [02:57:45](http://youtu.be/DgSLkakMDfE?t=02h57m45s) - Rhonda begins plug of [iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foundmyfitness-nutrition-science/id859601167), [website](http://www.foundmyfitness.com/), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/foundmyfitness), and [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/foundmyfitness/id818198322).

It is a massive pain in the ass to have to look directly at your phone to unlock it as compared to pressing your finger on something and not having to look at the device. It was especially frustrating trying to use my X to view a recipe. Everytime the phone locked I had to pick it  up and physically look at it as compared to just touching it and it unlocking. Every single person I talk to about it says the same thing, it is an inconvenience to ""look"" at the phone as compared to just using your hand. Its not an issue of Face ID ""working"" or not, its just an ergonomics and convenience issue that wasnt there before. You can tell they obviously wanted to get touch id through the screen to work but they couldnt pull it off in time. There is literally nothing else about the phone that is spectacular besides the face id and the screen. The call quality on my AT&amp;T spec X is also terrible, I routinely have to switch over to my personal 8 that is on verizon's network. I am not impressed for a phone that costs over $1200, I even cringed at dropping $1000 for my 8. Apple is just past the point of making a great product for a slightly more expensive price, its just completely unjustifiable at this point. If I wasnt given the X from work I would have returned it and gotten an Android device. I have been an Apple supporter and user for over 20 years, I have even seen Jobs speak at Macworld when that was a thing. The apple of today is making the same mistakes that led to their downfall when Jobs left the company the first time, its just this time they have a religious cult following to bank off of.

The EPA ruled a while ago that you could not have label designs like this in professional grade chemical products (ORM-D) and had to comply with the Global Harmonization System (GHS labeling standard). The EPA does not allow a ""professional grade"" or non-retail product to have imagery that could be confusing to the average consumer as to what the product inside the bottle is. GHS standards, which are adopted worldwide, also provided a unified pictograph system to help identify the dangers of the contents of a bottle, making it safer for the user of the product. After heavy lobbying on the legislation from the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Gojo (the makers of Purell hand sanitizer), Colgate and others, they amended the GHS compliance to exempt retail products. This is why you dont see any sort of warning symbol on cleaning products or detergents being sold in super markets, home depots, convenience stores, etc. The exemption for retail products also allows the manufacturers greater leway in label design leading to this very post."

I was a customer of Ben's maybe 4-5 years ago when he lived in Philly and he lived with another glassblowing friend of mine. I've known Ben for a long time, however we had a falling out because for a lack of better words, he is hard to deal with. I know other people in Philly felt the same way, IIRC he got fired from NameBrand Glass when that shop was still going. SO excuse me for finding it surprising that after not hearing about him for 4-5 years, after the guy pretty much vanished off the face of the earth after his time in philly, he ended up working for the mothership of all places. I am not saying he isnt talented, the dude kills it at blowing glass, just dealing with him personally is difficult in my experience. I still have rigs that I bought off him years ago, [heres a pic of one of them incase you dont believe me](http://imgur.com/a/mVDGx), notice the 2013 BG mille stamp. I actually just gave away a rig of his I had sitting around just the other week because I never used it, granted it was nothing crazy and just a little clear rig. I have way more to say about Ben than this, but again, Im not trying to throw salt. So nice call out dude, glad you obviously really know what you're talking about and feel like you can tell me who I am and what my experiences are. Jackass.

The merrells I have right now work great as both, but I am still planning on buying a dedicated trail shoe. I do more fell running then just ""trails"" so I find the extra grip and traction from a dedicated trail shoe gives me more confidence in the downhill sections when you really start to pick up speed. It also really counts in the truly offroad terrain where you may encounter streams/water, mud, or other conditions where a ""street"" shoe may not cut it. If you are going to be doing fell running and ""extreme"" offroad trails, having a dedicated trail shoe is worth it. If you are just doing occasional running on the trails, it is really not necessary. I split my time on the road and the trails pretty evenly so I found having a shoe for both situations was really beneficial for me.  "

I determined pretty early on that I love Cherry MX clears as you can see in my current family of boards. 

* Varmilo VA87M Blue case with orange backlight, Cherry MX Clears, stock light grey keycaps.
* Varmilo VA68M Gray case with orange backlight Cherry MX Clears, stock gray keycaps.
* Leopold FC660M Champagne case with Cherry MX Clears and a granite DSA keycap set I got from massdrop.

The Leopold was my first spec ordered board and my first love, it has a special place in my heart. However once I got my first Varmilo I don’t use it as much anymore. The VA87 is super nice and well constructed, but the VA68 is on another level in my opinion. The VA68 is so well built and heavy I reckon you could use it as a murder weapon. It is a seriously solid and heavy board, my friends are always surprised by the weight when I show it to them. I need to get new keycaps for the VA68 though to make it perfect. The stock keycaps from Varmilo have serious height and I found them uncomfortable. I have been using the VA87 for the past couple months as a result. The VA87 has the same style keycaps (just a lighter grey color), but the case is a little bit more low profile and lower to the table so the caps are not as uncomfortable as on the 68. I am probably going to end up getting different caps for both, I like a more low profile key. Thanks for reading and looking!"

This is something I feel is not discussed nearly enough. US has such a horribly inefficient tax system. People talk about the high Scandinavian taxes, but they not that different for the majority of people and what you get in return is huge.

They seriously need some kind of open government accounting system with national and global benchmarks on spending so its easy for people to see where money is spent and how that compares. I think something like this would be one of the greatest investments US could make these days."

The problem with China now is not because we shut down their investment options, its we left the door wide open before and slammed it shut part way through their influence strategy.

We should have been more protectionist from the beginning and set the right boundaries.

Now we need to pay the price for changing the game, which sux but we need to do that and stick to it. If we are consistent here things will normalise in time.

From here:

1)  Keep doing the 'right thing' and trading. Don't escalate but dont back down. Get partners like EU and US to put pressure on China that if they wont play fair in trade the wider market will sanction them. Politics &lt;&gt; trade.

2) Put in clear protective investment rules for all countries to help China save face and not feel picked on.

3) Send the diplomats out to expand relationships in EU, UK, USA, Japan and SEA. A goal should be no trading partner is more than ~15% ever again. I would put in a new tax rule companies pay 15% on foreign earnings. Take a page form Irelands book while encouraging Australian business to look outwards beyond ag and mining.

4) Put the breaks on Chinese migration to Australia. While looking to ensure Chinese Australians feel welcome and this issue doesn't conflate to them. We need to ensure the immigrants here are Australians and that takes seems to take 2-3 generations with any group influx.

5) Get foreign influence out of politics and universities. Quietly move out politicians that have been suspected of sucking the CCP teat and academics tied in with Confucius Institute e.g. Gladys Liu &amp; Professor Peter Høj.

Generally Id say return academic standards to foreign students. Get people that have brain power into this country, not degree mills.

6) Put in a serious strategy of bringing back strategic industry. Oil refineries, steel making, medical supplies. A car company or two (fuck Tony Abbott). And ensure we have basics covered so we have the option to survive isolation if there is escalation or another COVID etc.

7) Put stringent quality control on imports. Make importers pay for testing. Have some rating system so established importers can have less tests after proving they are good players to reduce costs to high quality products. 

This will have 2 effects of limiting low quality products coming in from China like flammable panels, and assist domestic production to compete better.

8) Look to compete with Singapore/HK and return to prominence our place in SEA banking world. If we become the safe/stable/private country that holds money there is security in that.

9) Fund the fuck out of tech and science so be can break the ag/mining export reliance.

2) If you are still unemployed after 4-6 months you go on a lower base payment and have to attend courses or community work at minimum wage equivalent amount of time.

3) If you refuse to turn up or perform at courses or community work only then you go onto a cashless card at an amount much less than if you did minimum wage hours.

At this point dont you start to question your views? You must realise the stretch it is to justify. Hundreds of thousands dying from a pandemic in you country, but imagine butter got expensive for a summer elsewhere.

I think 2 things would make a real difference to politics;

Other than a family home, any investable wealth has to go into a blind trust while in congress/senate + 3 years after. Plus laws against holding debt or other work arounds.

I would even consider if you serve congress/senate you agree to place a cap on your wealth and income permanently. Something like $500k/year and $5m net worth.

The government put generous fortnightly payments to cover higher unemployment payments plus similar for companies that had lost significant revenue to help pay staff. 

Lockdown brought the initial spike under control and let the trace team work in a reasonable level enviroment to quarantine people in contact with cases. And now trace teams do things like sewer testing so if there is a case they can know quickly and get on top of it.

As well as shutting international borders, we shut state borders mostly. This causes some controversy but seems to work well and most people in safe states were happy about this as out lives went back to normal while the outbreak states continued to deal with it. I think this was a critical factor in stopping spread, but also putting pressure on a couple of states to deal with it better as they were the odd ones out and looked bad.

We had a mini lockdown as soon as some new cases showed up. It seems clear they have to act fast. Idiots say 'why lockdown a state over a few cases' but this means its relatively easy to deal with and if you dont it will just be a larger problem in a month and a longer lockdown.

Most citizens were reasonable. We had a couple of protest and people holding parties etc but on the whole the people that didn't believe in COVID or limited activity were limited.

Probably a bunch more and there were some fuckups and it got politicised by some, the 'dont tell me what to do' politicians had to back off as most people realised how good we had it when we saw other countries and what was happening.

But the ads won't make as big of a difference and it's easy for new marketers to get confused about keywords since they don't 1) have industry experience, and 2) don't *really* understand user intent yet.

To start, you can either add tons of keywords or add just a few. I would just start with the services you provide and make an Ad Group for each of them. Start with the most relevant 10 keywords per Ad Group and make the ads specific to the service you provide. Let them run for a week to see if they get impressions. 

If your overall CTR is above 5%, don't turn anything off and add more Ad Groups and keywords over time. If your overall CTR is below 5% (or close to it), turn off some ""low-performing"" keywords. These are keywords that have the most impressions (think 100+ but just sort by impressions and start at the top) and a CTR much lower than 5%. Pause them. This should increase your CTR over time. 

Don't pause keywords with less than 50 impressions unless you think they are way off topic. An easy way to figure out if a keyword is relevant? Just Google it in an incognito browser. Seriously. If you search for a keyword and the results are off-topic, you can pause that keyword. There are so many instance where this pops up, so this should teach you about intent. 

In reality, it's more complicated than this to manage an account but I believe in starting with small systems that *actually* work. You can totally do this!

I've been managing a Google Ads account for a nonprofit I am on the board of directors of for the past 5 years. We only spend part of it, not the full $10k, since we are localized to a region. With your lack of experience, I would start small and scale up rather than try to spend it all and have a huge account you can't control and get confused by.

But I also needed to learn how to ""get things done"". Not every client needed a master plan. Sometimes, the strategy is simple. Just like creating a graphic/ad; sometimes it's better to get an ad live and see what the data says rather than spend a few extra hours getting it perfect. 

I had to learn that progress was more important than perfection. My idea of perfection wasn't even right. I had to lose my ego a little bit and learn how to be a good teammate and get things done. 

I would urge you to reflect on your ego and see if that's driving you to feel rushed and flustered. I would also urge you to take 30 minutes at the end of each week to reflect on your work. Look back at the past week. What took longer than it should have? What caused you to lose time? What did people rush you on? How can you work on those things? Or, how can you communicate to your teammates that they can help you get things done faster? If you're performing the same task for people, like creating Facebook Ads, give them a template to fill out with info you need to do it right: copy on image, image theme, landing page, target audience, etc.

If you find 1 thing each week to improve upon, you will find more pleasure in your work and you'll lose some of the stress. Even if you move jobs or quit, learning 1 thing each week will help you over the course of your career. 

You are definitely not crazy and it could purely be a rough agency. Most agencies I know of are very poor at managing projects and people so it's not a surprise."

Everyone thinks they want more flexibility but I don't think many people thrive on it. You will have to wear the business development hat that you're not wearing right now...whether you want to or not. 

* *How did you initially balance the full-time gig and freelance?* It took a while to get there. When I started treating myself like a client, it worked better. Basically, I had to set aside hours to work on my business in order for me to excel (planning, skills training, business development, etc.) 
* *When did you find it safe to quit your full-time gig?* Twice I've done this. Second, I had 1-2 clients and then landed a final, solid client that would cover all my living costs. Second time, I had a couple people reach out looking for help and I happened to be thinking about leaving. I ended up replacing my income by the time my 2-3 week notice ran up.
* *Any key learnings you have from making the transition?* Life isn't always magical so don't romanticize it too much. I do love it, thought. I do think switching from a fixed to growth mindset helps. People beg me to work with them sometimes. I thought I would do the begging when I was younger! But people have great businesses that need my help. It's important to instill that (oh, and to do good work).
* *Did you start with one industry or cast a wide net for your first clients?* I think this is the best way to build a company and grow but I have a pretty awesome network and I like supporting them on a variety of projects. I do work with companies in a certain stage, though.

Maybe look for another job while you freelance or have a serious talk about balancing your hours? I don't think going freelance will solve your main issue, which sounds like it could be turning off work. Your boss gives you work since he knows you will do it. What do you think you will do when it's 6pm and you *could* do some more work to get ahead of projects? 

Making sure that you aren't the problem would be my first step--and I say that as someone who has had to learn that lesson over and over again."

In the city:

* Richmond Hill Park: small park but there are some winding trails that make it seem bigger. We ran through it for a couple miles and really enjoyed it close to sunset. Not picturesque but very pretty. You can do anything from 0.7 - 4+ miles without taking the same trail twice. 
* River Arts district bike/pedestrian path: very nice path with a dedicated bike path and a full width walking path. There are a few places to park near the bridges and you can get a few miles or walking, running, or biking. I love this before sunset because it's still a little warm but cooling down. 
* You can also walk across most of the bridges over French Broad River. French Broad River Park is usually busy because it has a dog park (you can park there too). You can take it North or West and explore some other parks. I thought Carrier Park was super cool.

If it's your first time in the area, I'd recommend some hikes out of town. Boone and Blowing Rock are super cool places.

* Rough Ridge Lookout is apparently amazing, I've had to skip it several times for work and everyone gushes about it. 
* Linville Gorge is incredible. We are climbing out there this weekend. You can take Spencer Ridge Trailhead down to the river and it's fairly straight-forward. It's a moderate hike because of the elevation drop/gain but only \~1.5 miles. If you are in shape, it's easy. If not.
* On that note, everything around Table Rock is quite nice. The trail to the summit is about a mile and very accessible.
* Hebron Falls is a cool, easy hike at 3 miles total (out and back). There is also a 5 miles loop there that I have not done.
* Finally, the Linn Cove Viaduct is beautiful. It is crazy with traffic and that is not my vibe but it's worth driving through to see a sunrise (sunset is crazier from traffic perspective.) Just be safe about it and try not to be \_that\_ person who stops in the middle of the road...

I have mine attached and I think it's pretty normal. You don't assume liability for the company since it's attached to you, you just login with the same profile. What we do is make the company a Partner, then give People (individual profiles) access to that Partner. When we onboard a new client, we ask them to give access to our Partner profile so that they don't have to give access to several people. After that, we internally give access to People.

There are plenty of brands that would find it useful to have an american who speaks Japanese. International airlines, for example, are known for bringing people to america to liason between US and their home office. This applies to most countries.

The beauty of marketing is that it's a wide net of interests. If there is money in an industry, there is someone marketing that company or product. If you like Japan and chocolate, work for Nestle like my friend did :)

Overall, hes a quality player and I have no doubt about that. I think whether he fits our style and culture is the real question that i dont have an answer to. I think he would need to adapt his style.

His main quality is in his dribbling and passing. Hes smooth and has good short and mid range passing. Good positioning off the ball. Probably close to Gini in these aspects. He has played mostly in a similar role to our two forward-playing mids and he would be there for us. He likes to get in the box and go forward with his team. I'd say hes a far less dynamic Ox in this respect.

People on here comment about him being a 6...he just doesnt play that right now and I think it would take years to get there. He could work as a double pivot maybe? But his tackling isnt great,  he never breaks up play in transition or intercepts, and he doesnt stand out when pressing. Honestly, I cant remember if he pressed much in his role or not since I haven't watched him in a few weeks. It may just be that hes really timid defensively. Better than Can was technically but he doesnt have the intangibles that he brings to a team.

I really like him but I'm not sure what he brings to the team beyond what we have. He would replace lallana and...not play much. If we lost Milner to Leeds then he wouldn't fill his leadership or pressing gap. 

It may be a good development year for him if he can carve out his own role at the club but I think he would need to develop in a big way to become more than a cup player in the next year or two."

Much of real estate (Development companies, property management companies, etc.) work very slow but also have lots of writing needs: website, listings, brochures, proposals, etc. Try looking at companies that have writing needs but won't be in your face every day.

I would take this opportunity to work on your skills: if you work slow, try speed writing every day for a week. Just freewrite as much as possible. Or draft 20 different campaign ideas for a company you like. Or write 2 blog posts per day. Think of it as pushing yourself into an uncomfortable area and see what happens. I am a visual learner, so I would find a few YouTube videos and channels to level up my skills or get new perspectives. I would also read about how people organize their time and day.

If I wasn't up to par, it showed me what I needed to work on. If the client had a bad experience, it helped them learn what to look for when hiring someone. It's about making progress. It sounds like you've made some progress already by seeking advice and acknowledging the things you already have experience on.

I think it's a mistake to use ads right now for fresh leads (waste of time and money).

Unique content is great for a page--text content that only your site has. In addition, reviews contain highly relevant language to your product (I'm assuming it's a physical product). The review mentions shipping, features, etc. and all of that adds context to the page. Lastly, Google will expect you to have reviews on product pages. Why would they want to rank a product on the first page without a review section? Products get reviewed, it's part of the business model.

Every character adds page weight but text is especially light. Longer pages are worth the tiny amount of page weight and there are plenty of other ways to increase page speed before you start sacrificing text. That would be the last thing I cut."

I won't give advice on the actual work since that's not my specialty (sounds like branding/messaging?) but I will say a few things about organizational change.

1. The first time you roll someone out company-wide, it's probably the hardest time. Each big change will become easier than the one before it.
2. It's a lot more work than I ever considered, even at small companies.

My experience here has been mostly process and tool change--how do we get 10 - 30 people to utilize a new process. It sucks, usually. You have to have a plan for the change--one that goes beyond this idea: ""Our changes are happening May 1. Please read the document and let me know if you have questions."" No one will ever have questions but they will also not follow through with it.

People will ignore it because they have problems with revenue, they have conflicting priorities, and sometimes they just don't understand it. Someone has to get buy-in, real buy-in, from stakeholders and have a plan to overcome the common hurdles--like the ones I mentioned and the ones that are unique to your company. After all, it's understandable to hear your sales director say: ""This change will drop our revenue for two quarters and my sales team lives on commissions, how do you expect me to tell them they won't make as much money?""

Last time I worked on a project like this, I think we failed at it. But I found [this Mckinsey report immensely helpful](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/public%20sector/pdfs/how_do_i_implement_complex_change_at_scale.ashx). It helped me prepare for the conversations with stakeholders and the initial conversations were *perfect*. It was the execution that went wrong.

Good luck on it!"
everythingswan;t1;1588073057.0;r/AskMarketing;2020-04-28;11:24;of course, no problem
everythingswan;t1;1588011532.0;r/AskMarketing;2020-04-27;18:18;"The practical experience of any job within digital marketing is way more helpful than the theory at the very beginning. I love the theory and it will set you apart from others when you're 3+ years in. As a beginner (an assistant, coordinator, or entry-level), it's way better to know the tools that you'll be using and have the skill to execute a plan.

I think you should talk to people who do a specific thing, social media management like you mentioned, to get the details of it. 

I manage search and social ads for people and here's the work, broken out at a basic level:

1. Launch a Campaign
2. Manage the Campaign
3. Report on the Campaign
4. Meet weekly or at end of month to inform client, discuss improvements, etc.

All of that is the easy stuff. I should only need a brand's Facebook page and Ad Account. Here are the hard things

* But how do you know the structure of the campaign? 
* Does the client have the ability to truly measure success? 
* Do you have enough budget to AB test? 
* Is poor performance on you or the website/funnel? 
* Are they running the right offer, or is it too good or too bad? 
* Are other channels impacting your performance? 
* Does the client like ""pretty"" reports over my data-first ones?
* Are you getting the right or wrong customers?
* Do your clients actually understand the things you're reporting or do you have to spend more time educating them? 
* Are the right potential customers clicking on your ads or is it people looking for free stuff?

All of that takes time and expertise and that comes with experience. 

I think you should chop off a little bit of something that you are both interested in and understand and start finding gigs like that. It will help you understand the actual work that goes into it. I learned a lot about other parts of marketing, like PR, by working with people who were good at it. Main lesson: combine hands-on experience with reading, courses, or listening to people with experience to get the full grasp of it. No one takes a Udemy course seriously as a resume point.

I don't know how viable Fiverr is for you so I can't really comment there. I don't think doing gigs on Fiverr is a good long-term strategy but it may be the best way to get projects under your belt. 

The thing that gave me momentum to freelance was having a $150 project under my belt. Small potatoes, but I could call myself a ""freelancer"" and refer to ""my clients"". No one really cared but me but the permission I got from that was great. Find a client or two, what they pay you doesn't matter, and discover the problems that come up. You'll learn a lot by solving those problems like the ones I listed."
everythingswan;t1;1587764156.0;r/AskMarketing;2020-04-24;21:35;"I have a pretty strong network (for me, that means smart people, they like to work, good values, I like them too). I skew introverted but I'm good with 1:1 conversations so I decided I'd just get coffee with people to get to know them instead of doing lots of networking groups and meetups. This worked really well for me. If you are similar (dislike networking, like learning about what people do), it's probably worth trying.

Basically, I consistently get coffee with people I liked in marketing and general business and we'd bring new people to meet up sometimes. I found that people I really got along with would always want to connect me with other people, usually without asking. I'd also do the same--sometimes it's connecting them because they could work together. Sometimes it's just because they would like each other. To meet new people, take curiosity in who they are and what you do. Learn to be interested, truly interested, in what they do and who they are.

I also try and stay in touch with people through email and social if we're on the same wavelength. Half my network is remote now because my clients are all remote, so we all do the same thing. We do hangouts to catch up sometimes. I've never met some people in real life but we stay in touch anyway. 

If you do this or choose to do another thing, just know it'll feel weird at first. You might be thinking that emails sound like I'm annoying people, not meeting in person sounds weird, or grabbing coffee could sound like a date but the reality is that it's pretty normal to do those things in my position. It will feel more normal over time. Try several options and see what works for you specifically."

I like to have 4-6 clients at a time since I don't subcontract, work hands on beyond advertising and directly with the client, \_and\_ I typically work on accounts with $5-50k/month in ad spend.

You know you need to arrive at the recommendation to move budget from poor-performing campaigns, ads, or platforms to better-performing ones. So you have a good idea of how to identify the metrics that make something good or bad and you also have an idea on how to evaluate those metrics. 

I think the visual is a nice bonus and they should love that if it is illustrative. They are probably very interested in how you got to your recommendations (I would be) so that's a great idea.

I like to start looking at Sources of traffic. What's working? What's not? What does \_working\_ mean to begin with? Social and display could simply be the CTR, which you can calculate. How does each campaign or creative type perform? Is it the same over time or has something stopped performing well recently?

With websites, same thing. What pages have solid metrics vs bad ones? Which channels perform well? Is there anything you can infer from your experience that might be interesting? Like ""Direct"" and ""Organic"" perform the best, always, when it comes to pageviews and bounce rate. Or maybe the organic is terrible because people are searching for an answer, getting it, then bouncing. 

Lastly, I'd tie it into Insights &amp; Recommendations. Avinash Kaushik turned me onto that procedure for reporting. He included Business Value as the third level but it's superfluous for most of my work.

Generate a few insights for each of the three sets of data, think 2-5. Then, extract 1-2 recommendations based on those insights. Are some campaigns performing poorly? Recommend that you re-evaluate them and push budget to the campaign that is consistent. 

Hope that helps. Good luck!"

I enjoy watching Dortmund and think he belongs in a team with a similar style so he can continue to develop. I have no preference (other than I regularly watch Bundesliga) but I would hope for his sake he stays with clubs and managers that are similar to Dortmund's style right now.

Firmino is perfect in his role now, can't agree more. 

I think something drastic would have to happen to need to play primarily in the 4231 since they're in such good form.

After all, United and Arsenal continue to have money and continue to under-perform. And they're used to having it. How is a club going to do when they have it for the first time ever? Watford are currently shitting the bed. Fulham splashed a ton of cash and got relegated. West Ham are currently poor despite expensive signings.

Without a paid tool, look either at your own analytics (organic traffic to pages) or Google Search Console to ID the pages that have dropped. You can pick a date and then do a comparison range over the previous period. If it's specific pages, that tells you something. If it's 50% of pages, that says it may be another thing.

Even with the ball it didn't look like the team was comfortable. Is Yedlin instructed to play deep crosses like that?

* Prospective client material includes the same message (emails, whitepapers, etc.)
* You can pitch other publications and mention that WSJ covered your product and thought they might be interested too
* Backlinks, of course.

2. then toss the couscous to brown, it should only need 60 seconds before you see it turn, i keep it active in the cast iron while this happens.
3. toss in some chopped garlic near the end, i want it to cook but realistically that shit burns fast so i let it sit on top of the couscous for 20 seconds while i...
4. Season with salt, rosemary, w/e.
5. throw thighs back in that bad larry
6. Pour in a cup or so of chicken stock
7. Put things away.
8. Put cast iron in the oven until couscous cooks and it starts to get creamy
9. Finish off with orange zest

It's incredibly rich if you use some butter in there. I also use packed couscous sometimes. The Near East(?) flavors work well and I only eat the larger, Israeli couscous since I like the texture better and I find it easier to cook. Rosemary and garlic flavors here kill it when I make for others."

everythingswan;t1;1570475629.0;r/AskMarketing;2019-10-07;19:13;"I think you need to get out from behind the computer and talk to the people setting appointments. Where do the clients say they are hearing about you? If you don't have any feedback loop, it's going to be hard to figure out what works. You'll never know 100% of it, but you should strive to have a good idea of how people find and interact with you across your channels.

It's not a one and done thing to show someone an ad and have them book a consultation. These are busy people who have jobs, kids, etc. They will see ads and do research when they have free time. The analytics says 40% of customers came in (direct) / none, but do you think people are just typing in your URL because they guessed a random URL was magically the exact service they were looking for? Of course not. They talked to a friend, remembered your name on a lunch break, and typed it in. Or maybe their friend texted them a link. Or maybe they had their spouse Google your name after they walked by your office last month, their spouse found the URL, then they typed it in. 

The email opens, paid clicks, phone calls, etc. are just indicators. Track the indicators week by week and then see if that correlates to bookings. It probably does, at least loosely. 

When bookings drop and your boss asks about it, look at the indicators. Most of the time, something will add up: maybe you spent budget earlier than normal for ads because you added some keywords, maybe it was the first week of school and your market is parents, or maybe everyone got hit with a social update and 20% fewer people saw your posts over the past two weeks.

The reality is that most brands have a direct to consumer option to buy and that only makes up a portion of their sales. While it sounds like you're competing against yourself, you're better off thinking of it as a separate market:

1. You compete against Amazon on Google (search, or organic search is a channel)
2. You compete against comparable products on Amazon itself (Amazon's marketplace is a channel, just like getting your product in-store is a channel)

It's messy, yea. But it's a big mis-step to not exist on a platform because you feel like you're competing against yourself. It only works if you have a tremendous amount of demand for your product--then consumers will do more work to find you--and that usually comes down to having an amazing brand or some other competitive advantage.

If you are light on time, I'd probably focus on nailing your website's on-site SEO and basic UX. If it functions and reflects your brand, let it sit and build up equity with Google.

Then I'd focus more on Amazon, with the assumption that there is demand for your product and you actively get sales there. If your market sells through Amazon then I'd draft off the channel's demand. Over time, shift more time to focus on your website UNLESS there is no way you'll get return from it. For instance, selling toothbrushes direct-to-consumer would only work if you have a tiny niche, like being so green you won't sell through AMZN. Regular toothbrushes?

* Caffeine DT: small and less foot traffic. They have a couch in the back where no one is usually seated. I don't like their coffee as much. They have an Armenia location that I don't really like.
* Victory in Channelside: pretty social spot but most people grab their stuff to go so it's good because it's not crowded for seating, food is good, and espresso is good. They have a ton of tea options if that's your thing. I do weekend mornings here and love it.
* Starbucks at the Hilton DT? Shocking, I know. But there is usually seating, great wifi, and they have these little alcoves where it's dark and a little private. Check it out. 
* Portico DT is cool because it's attached to a social cause, addressing homelessness. I was there 2 months ago and it was solid. Staff was, as you'd expect, very friendly. It seemed like they were trying to cater to casual lunch meetings and private workers so it was great. I plan to go back as my Foundation Plan B.
* The Lab is near UT. Really solid coffee but I like it better to meet friends at. I tried reading a few times there and it was just a little too social. But really nice people and they love coffee. 
* Oxford Exchange ONLY to read offline. Their WiFi is not public WiFi last I checked. Also background noise is heavy. This is the lowest option on my list and I go like 2x/year for these reasons. It's great for lunch meetings IMO.

I bet you're probably talking about a period well before then. It's just a hunch but I think you might just be getting in front of the wrong audience. Anyone who isn't a good fit is a critic and you don't really need to cater to those critics early on. When they offer advice, nod your head and move along. Moving along = try a new channel strategy. If you posted on Hacker News and didn't get new users, try ProductHunt, cold email outreach, or Quora. 

Honestly, it's just really hard to do early on. It's a great sign that you've hit resistance and aren't giving up--because it might have nothing to do with your product. Keep trying things. After you've tried 3-4 things, you can take a step back and look at the response to each and determine better why they weren't a good fit. Perhaps it was the audience...perhaps it was your pitch.

If you worked in media buying then some of the reporting feedback will be simple for you to grasp. Sales CRMs are simple. You'll also understand pipelines since they are similar to marketing funnels.

I think identifying a few industries you would like to work in, then identifying a few positions that you would like to try (even if more senior than you can handle now), then the entry level positions that come before that...you can craft a little plan to get there. 

It's a risk but its worth trying sooner rather than later. I have a friend who tried this and it didnt work out right away--i think there were some flaws in her plan. But now her new plan is even better and I think she has a solid chance of getting her ideal job."

Years ago, I would use an Excel Template to bulk upload like...15 campaigns with 60 total ad sets and 400 total ads...and it was really easy. I'd get bonked out every once in a while but the system worked. Easy export, easy import. I could resolve issues in the Power Editor in most cases.

I only have 1 similarly complex account right now which has 200 ad sets and I just can't get it to work with the template. Something ALWAYS breaks and is un-fixable in the interface. In the old Power Editor, at least I could fix it in the editor before pushing. Now, have to go back to Excel to start. I never figured it out.

I went to Excel because I was getting errors duplicating the initial campaign due to the large number of objects I was trying to duplicate. That hasn't happened in weeks so I'm back to working it in the Ads Editor. If I had to, I'd probably duplicate in the editor, then export to Excel for changes, then re-upload. But honestly the changes I make don't really require that.

For anyone suffering from too many objects and a headache from the Excel template, I actually started duplicated parts of the account when an update was required. So with 1 campaign with 200 ad sets, I'd dupe the campaign with the first 100 ad sets and ads, then dupe the second 100 ad sets and ads and add them to the existing campaign I just duplicated. Duct tape solution."

everythingswan;t1;1562266291.0;r/AskMarketing;2019-07-04;18:51;"When you pay for an agency vs. a freelancer, you're paying a premium for a few reasons. There are some good responses here and I'll add a layer on top of a few that is specific to one in-house person hiring for multiple things.

An agency essentially helps reduce uncertainty and the risk that you flop. Not necessarily in practice, all the time...but the theory is there. 

Imagine a CEO or Founder who doesn't know a whole lot about digital marketing. They're willing to pay more so that they only have to vet 1 person--the person they deal with at the agency. The alternative would be that they have to vet each freelancer individually. Not only will they have to go through that process with each of them, they'll now have to manage them individually.

An agency would hire people with the same philosophy to execute with the same strategy.

I do have thoughts that most new businesses hire agencies too early but it's an access thing: do they have access to freelancers or just agencies? Owners tend to run with other business owners so the link to an agency is usually stronger. 

I usually push new companies to try something themselves, then hire freelancers to improve it, then move it in-house or expand with an agency."

everythingswan;t1;1560533192.0;r/AskMarketing;2019-06-14;17:26;"I think your instincts are pretty good. The reality is that there are many paths to success and failure so I'd do the one you feel confident in. The good news is that you can always add/change/remove products and websites in the future. 

My preference is to focus energy to the point where you get the most value, which is why I think that focusing on 1 brand makes sense. The only drawback is that you won't have any benchmarks to compare it to. So if a page converts at 1%, is that the conversion rate for all toys across the web? Or is it a problem with your setup?

I would still tackle 1 at a time but I would try to reach the point where you have a system that you understand and that works: a true marketing program. That means that you know if you: run $2k in ads per month, have a freelancer manage/engage in social for $500/month, and spend 20 hours reaching out to blogs to get coverage, you are making good progress and generating sales. Then, start tackling the others. Unless the opportunity is so big on the main brand that you need to capitalize on momentum.

I'd also do those things yourself, when possible, until you can pass it off to a part-time marketing manager or one of the in-house employees. When you can see how it all fits, move it off your plate. 

To contradict myself, I think that you could hire freelancers to spend 3 months building out each of the products and then only keep the one that performs the best. I think you'd learn a lot more than going one at a time and you could always shut down or consolidate any marketing that you did. Depends on budget and access to quality people."
everythingswan;t1;1559839871.0;r/marketing;2019-06-06;16:51;Just cost and tool preference as far as I know. I have come across Klipfolio a few times but haven't used it. Sounds like the difference is per connector versus per dashboard.
everythingswan;t1;1559831018.0;r/marketing;2019-06-06;14:23;"Agree on this. It's not perfect but it's a tool that's worth $50/month for the smallest marketing department and it's free &amp; easy to learn/use. Supermetrics will cost you but it's pretty cheap for the value you get. 

I think you should start with who will use them and what you need them for (the why). I've had more success creating reports and dashboards for specific groups of people or use cases than aggregating 10+ page monsters that serve many people of different roles. No one views the latter.

So if you have an exec team dash, high-level marketing dash, and a high-level sales dash then you are on the right path. They'd be 1 - 3 pages each and focus mostly on the KPI's for those teams (marketing = traffic sources, landing pages, etc. and sales = visual pipeline) and then probably a small section with KPI's from other teams that influence them, i.e. if marketing leads drop then you'd expect the sales pipeline to slow down and vice-versa.

When you add more team members to sales and marketing, you can expand beyond 1 - 3 pages per dashboard and get deeper into channels. 

I think dashboards are better used to dictate more analysis (Sales leader: ""Hm, leads dried up, I should ask marketing team if they changed anything or our sales reps dropped the ball qualifying them too slowly"") and monthly reports are best to describe what was analyzed and the changes you made (""As you can see by this data, we launched LinkedIn campaigns. We spent $3000 and got 20 leads for $150/lead. We are testing our pitch and hope to decrease that to $100/lead. We also will have end-to-end results  in the next 2-3 months after the sales team works them."").

A good qualifier is asking about companies like you that they have worked with. Local SEO and Local PPC (Local...everything) is way different than marketing for enterprise companies. It's truly a skill set and it's hard to be good at both. If they have worked with local companies and can tell you about what makes local different, that's a good sign. If they shrug and say they are great at everything...probably a bad sign.

The best tip I can give is to keep internalizing what you learn from these people. Ask them what keywords they were bidding on, or what ads they were using, or what audiences they were targeting. Over time, you'll improve your performance if you make some time for it each week."
everythingswan;t1;1558614638.0;r/marketing;2019-05-23;12:30;"Not OP but my thoughts since I see it a lot:

""Analysis"" is hard for people but it really means drilling down: What do I have at my disposal and how can I make sense of it?

With Facebook Ads, you have gender, age, placements, device, etc. Which of those perform best? Push money to those. Whenever I work with a smaller account, it's all about setting it up correctly and then rolling through my process from high priority to low. If I can only spend a little time on it, then I can only analyze 1-2 of those each week. It's the same for Google Ads and other campaigns.

The challenge is that there's a smaller sweet spot for local marketing. I can't bill a normal retainer and work 8 hours a month on an account with a media budget of $500/month. Especially if you want to run Google *and* FB Ads. Economics just don't support it. I can't give you robust reporting or really any insights that aren't automated since they take time (being a little dramatic but analysis time varies each month.). So what do you do?

So as a local business owner you are honestly hoping to get lucky: finding someone who is hungry for the work (maybe they just left a job to start freelancing) or is new to freelancing, great at what they do, and haven't realized their worth yet. Otherwise, you need someone in-house whose part-time job is to do it. Hopefully they like it!

Setting up Google Analytics is definitely one of those baseline things so if they aren't doing that then you need to do it if you're hoping to drive any web leads. You have to see what works."
everythingswan;t1;1558481211.0;r/SEO;2019-05-21;23:26;"I know a few good freelancers, some are SEO-focused, and their best client relationships (good client outcomes or massive learnings) come from our network. It's like 80% referrals.

So I would recommend you explore your own network. Even asking people who are not working in SEO or online marketing if they know anyone. Ask smart people. Then meet or chat with 3 - 5 people and pick the best fit.

Not everyone knows someone good, so be aware of that, but there are tons of reasons why those relationships tend to work better. 

You should also realize that your first choice may not work out over time. Finding good freelancers is an art itself so don't be hard on yourself if you don't nail it right away."

As far as social, I think a little money goes a long way with causes. I think you should use the list of people who already use your program as the basis for your lookalike audience (upload it to the audience manager as a csv file) and spread your message that way. 

As for the message: keep it positive and make it visceral. I do some volunteering with some local nonprofits, sometimes helping with marketing and sometimes just extra hands, and from my research and experience the best nonprofits have a few stories that really hit home.

I bet you can filter it out if you report through Data Studio if you report through it. If it was imported from GA then you can use a custom segment to exclude that goal too--although it's a bit messy since you are excluding sessions or users who completed that goal and not the goal itself."
everythingswan;t1;1555549638.0;r/AskMarketing;2019-04-18;01:07;"I would evaluate the reasons why, first. Obviously I don't know how well you speak English but perhaps they are worried that English will be a language barrier for you to write or speak. 

Did you do any marketing for English websites or products back home? Sharing that would be a great start. Or talking about your experience marketing yourself in two different languages. 

It could be that you present yourself in a way where you are worried about your lack of experience in the US when you could really present it as something very interesting and unique about you. I think being multi-lingual is a great asset. I would talk about interesting things you've noticed in your work between your home and here. I know that SEO and PPC both have really important nuances in other countries. 

Also, do you have a visa to work in the US? I know some employers see that as an extra process they need to navigate and that may be the real reason you are having trouble. Small companies don't have many resources."
everythingswan;t1;1555549199.0;r/AskMarketing;2019-04-18;00:59;Yea, good idea to do this to be on the safe side!
everythingswan;t1;1555549128.0;r/PPC;2019-04-18;00:58;"30% of $3k makes sense, albeit \_a bit\_ high, because there are fixed costs for anything: builds, reporting, meetings, etc. And then the analysis has a variable amount of time, similar to G Ads. 

Rev share part...yea that's crazy. Especially when we're talking revenue and not profit. If you hit $3k revenue, then you're paying $900-1200 in management fees and an additional $450-900 in rev share. So you're at$1350 - 2100 in advertising costs, without even calculating your time, your creative team's time to create a video/images (and to iterate on those if they don't work), and the COGS of the actual product. If you have a high profit margin that would give you some room or they would have to get lucky and get big wins early.

I usually recommend action over inaction (unless money is super tight) but this is over the line heavy for me. I'd keep asking your network for referrals and wait. You already said he doesn't stand out with knowledge so why would he be any good at hiring? That's a red flag for me."

I've worked with some startups who were trying to define a category and/or create some demand for something new. They were still trying to find their place in the market.

Q2: Sounds like you just want to use calculated fields, right? Easy to implement by Editing the Data Source and clicking ""Add a Field"". It looks like the dimension name is ""Site Search Status"" for searches made (double check that tho) and then you'll have to figure out how GA measures 0 results. I think it depends on how you've implemented site search: does the URL have a parameter? Do you have an event set up to measure those? If you figure that out, you're golden.

Local SEO is quite a bit different since you have tools/results that don't translate from typical, national SEO. You've got the local and map listings, local directories that people actually use like Yelp, and multiple locations of your own to deal with. It's strange.

You can do a quick and dirty version where you make them events and then create a custom segment of users who have triggered that event. The timeline gets wonky though since they could have ""converted"" before they clicked your CTA but it definitely works. 

After you create the segment and apply it, you could look at the Acquisition Report or the eCommerce data if you're an eCommerce shop."

Then aligning what you want to do with what they need comes next, unless you already know what they need specifically. It's iterative and nonlinear. Most freelancers (and companies too) never really grasp their own value or why people buy from them.

""I build websites for new, local businesses"" is a great way to answer that. 

""People hire me as their part-time lead developer"" is a great start too.

""Companies who use React hire me to supplement their full time team"", decent.

I think a title is fine and useful but it really doesn't convey much. When I tell people ""I'm a marketing consultant"", I get glazed over looks and immediate disinterest. They ask what that means or what I do next. Same if I saw Advertising Consultant, freelancer, working in digital marketing...anything. So figure out a better way to convey who you are, what value you provide, and who you like working with.

If you just want some side projects for now, I wouldn't overthink it. I would just talk to people and then see what they ask you and what they or their friends need help with. Listening is a great way to ""sell""."

You can't say you're the biggest  social network unless you're Facebook. You can't say you're the ""Everything Store"" unless you're Amazon. IKEA, Walmart, Starbucks. Lots of examples.

So what you have to do is position yourself against the opposition. Starbucks might be on every corner, but you can have the highest quality coffee or be the best place to have a coffee meeting--these are ways to be the best to specific types of customers.

I think it can create some demand, some word of mouth, and help you generate lots of momentum because 10 people wearing the same shirt at an event stands out if the event is only 200 people. People will google your brand at the event. They will talk about you so hopefully your team is professional and friendly. And as for momentum, I think that comes from being prepared to talk about who you are and what you do--having that messaging uniform across all of your employees.

Those always drag down the CTR.

If you are getting signups at a decent rate, $6.50/lead also seems like a good start, keep pushing the product side. There's really nothing we can tell you to do because you don't have a product to sell and, therefore, we can't calculate the end-to-end conversion rate.

* As expected, he passed the ball well and looked comfortable on the ball the whole game
* Had a wild hand go up defending a ball in the box in the first 15, gave up a pen that Shalke missed. He didn't let him shake him up, although they did miss it. Definitely a dumb penalty but honest mistake it seemed.
* He played CM in what looked like a 442 diamond. It may have shifted to a 451 later--I walked away for a couple minutes twice in the game. He looked good there on both sides of the ball and clearly likes it when he's not the deepest Mid. The whole team held shape well and he was a part of that. 

My criticisms are light. 

* I think he was poor in the air. They played the ball to him in the air several times in the last 20 and I don't think he won a single header--even when Naldo pushed further up. Just weak on where he positions himself on those and he never really gave himself a shot to win them. 
* I think he prefers receiving the ball to his feet a little too much. He has good passing range so it makes sense that he would prefer that but I felt like he lacked some assertiveness when they had the ball. He could have easily moved into space a few times  and run onto the ball a bit and chose not to. Might be down to directions/tactics.

Even if you price it by month, it's still based on the amount of time you put in. So just draft out the things he wants done and the range of hours it will take you, then multiply by your freelance rate. So if you spend 10 hours per month each on social media and taking pictures, that's 20 hours x $35/hr = $700/month. It's not abnormal to charge more in Month 1 if you have to do extra things that you won't have to do after that, like setting up pages, etc.

I think the challenge with the other comment here is just that value to the client is largely out of your control, so it's not like you can gauge performance on your own. So he has some preconceived notion of how much he values this work to his business and it's probably not directly ROI-based.

If the problem is the freelance rate, that's a tough one to answer. Largely based on the value to the client and, in my experience, purely based on their previous experience. Might ask if he has worked with a marketing agency before, who they were or where they were located, and how it was. He may fill you in that they were too expensive or that the experience was great. Agencies charge more per hour so that can inform your rate. If he has only had free interns...that'll have the opposite effect.

I think you can get both of those things without college. You already have an internship lined up which will give you some connections and knowledge. I would keep investing in those as much as you can outside the internship. Reading/watching/listening and then executing at the same time is the fastest way to develop yourself professionally. So work hard at the internship and then do some combo of the following (whatever works for you but also what pushes you out of your comfort zone):

* Grab people you work with and getting some face time to ask about their path and what they find interesting
* Reach out to people you admire locally or via email and try to give them some value if you can
* Read books or blogs, listen to podcasts, or watch videos about things you find interesting
* Execute on a daily basis: build a website, run a sweepstakes, create a twitter parody account...whatever you're learning, you need to spend time doing it. Theory doesn't pay the rent.

 I would also reach out to management at the company you have an internship with and see if they would be open to hiring someone without a degree. Then reach out to a ton of other companies and agencies and ask the same.

Both so entertaining."
everythingswan;t1;1524258035.0;r/soccer;2018-04-20;21:00;"I think the downvotes are only for your certainty that Suarez was the only cause. I don't think anyone would disagree that it's by far the biggest--only that there were substantial other ones, such as Gerrard's permanent dip in form as the 6, Sturridge playing about 15 games the following year, and in general BR being a stick in the mud about tactics (re: Benteke, wingbacks). 

I always felt like it was his lack of experience and perhaps a lack of humility due to Suarez on the last point--I think we will find out only as the years go by.

I agree you can find a better transition manager in that context, if that's what you want. I would say that the Arsenal of recent years has embraced an identity along the lines of Barca, to the extent that many people think has been a fault. If I was an Arsenal fan, I'd want to maintain that identity."
everythingswan;t1;1524169824.0;r/soccer;2018-04-19;20:30;"He's getting a lot of hype this year, especially after Europe performances, and I think it's fair to say he'll grow into an even more useful player. 

I'm not naive to his lackluster performances earlier and into the middle of the season. It's clear he's not an elite defender and that's ok. I'm more excited about the growth he showed year over year. 

Two years ago in pre-season he was bad. Kid was 17-18 at the time, seemed unsure of himself...just didn't play well at all. He was a kid and played like one. 

This year in pre-season he looked like the real deal. Put on good weight, way more confident on the ball, understood his role, and played like a pro. He didn't run the pitch like he was 18.

I think most pro's that develop tend to level up over the summer and different points in their career. At Liverpool, we've seen Suarez, Coutinho, Hendo, etc. all take it to a new level over the summer and TAA did the same, although to a much lesser degree obviously. I'm not going to sound the hype train for him to become world class but I think that if he can repeat what he did over the last summer again this year or the next then he'll be a quality player. 

I don't see this it as a fluke like maybe Flanagan's wonder-ish season a few years ago. It's really up to him to see how far it goes."

It's also great to learn from other people. Working on projects with people who have way more experience in analytics with supercharge your learning.

I'd guess that these brands had an option to use the brand or not, brands as in Coke or Pepsi. They could have easily created a new brand (and I assume they did try it) but the job they were trying to get done was to deliver the ""same great taste"" but with 0 calories. 

It's actually a great idea to create a different brand if you're trying to tackle a different problem or deliver a different kind of experience. You might think of Crystal Pepsi as a failed example of this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Pepsi Although I drank it at the time, I have no idea if it was supposed to be different or not. Not too much detail in the Wiki, but it sounds like the purity angle was to reach a new group of people who saw soda as too syrup-like--perhaps? 

Coke zero is an interesting one and I don't know the case for that at all. But it's important to remember that it came out so long after the diet soda that the market changed quite a bit. So looking at the expansion into Diet might have served the same purpose as the expansion into Zero. "
everythingswan;t1;1475292179.0;r/AskMarketing;2016-10-01;03:22;"Does it have to be a direct successor? I'm not sure if brand means just their brand or their core competencies. Good question though. Maybe one of these examples is a good fit.

Diet soda is a good example of something that expanded the appeal of a product category since it overcame the objection of wasting calories or being worried about weight gain.

Also might look to tablets and laptops as the former is considered a replacement for the latter. Microsoft and Apple both did this with the Surface and iPad vs. the PC and Macintosh.

Fast food restaurants have done this quite a bit as they bring in new breakfast items, such as specialty coffee. McCafe comes to mind.

Lastly, Lexus is a luxury brand that is owned by Toyota. Toyota's brand can't compete in the high end auto market because it means something else, something much more affordable. Instead of moving product up marketing, they have a luxury brand under the Toyota umbrella. Lexus still means luxury. This may not fit your question very well. 

This is another loose example but Pixar, although always wanting to produce feature films, initially didn't make a dime doing that. I can't recall if they dealt with hardware or software primarily, but they certainly leveraged their tech and their employees to produce feature films.

They'd all want different things, so figure out how to segment them initially with different value and then speak to them differently on a regular basis. I'd just start with one segment and see how it goes."

Personally I fully believe it helped provide momentum and spur action from developers specifically in New Center, Milwaukee Junction, North End because it gives those areas more connectivity. I would think the management at Hopcat would tell you it provides incremental value. The station is positioned right outside their door.

And to be fair- I'm not a QLine booster- I get its problems from too few trains to ETAs always being off, not being built in center lane, not going far enough, etc. its underwhelming from an RTA perfective. But at the same time it is possible to see its benefits it provides to local business and for people who come in from out of town or the suburbs for a day."

So I think we are in agreement. Except the how. I want controllers but only to instantiate my pipelines. I rarely to never use middleware because I don't have fine tuned controller over it.

Edit: reread your question..

By front load I was referring to doing all the business logic in controllers. And abuse meant basically starting to do database work inside middleware, which is not its intention outside maybe route binding (which I do not care for)."

Middleware is just an implementation of pipelining but at a very early point in the request stack. And from an architecture perspective everything you bake into middleware you are black boxing. 

Laravel offers some great things like route binding. But Laravel also gives you enough rope to hang yourself with a very poorly architected application. It really doesn't direct you on how to organize/build your code once inside the controller. That is what this package is meant for, to help you organize your code into a concise, highly tested, granular flow."

shampine;t1;1600272685.0;r/PHP;2020-09-16;16:11;"Hey thanks for commenting/checking out the package! 

Middleware is a type of pipeline. So very similar. Pipelines is more akin to functional programming as you basically pass a single object through a series of functions.

In my package these are called processes. What my package does is help scaffold your pipeline setup in the controller for super clean, well structured, well architected, and well tested code.

I've written a few variants of this package over the last 3-4 years and used it at scale with a large set of developers. It is a decent amount of boilerplate, which is where the package comes in. But it offers developers three ways to share code: a function (service, model, repository) OR a process OR a pipeline.

Here's a very very high level post I wrote about how pipelines work. Maybe seeing the mutation in pseudocode will help remove the dark magic.

shampine;t1;1600272230.0;r/PHP;2020-09-16;16:03;"To piggy back on this, middleware is great for some things:

- authorization
- post/patch data mutation (not business logic, e.g. remove white space)
- post/patch data checks
- **maybe** validation

But there is some line you have to draw where don't want to use middleware. I see a lot of people in Laravel abuse it and front load controllers. This is poor application design."
shampine;t1;1600272019.0;r/PHP;2020-09-16;16:00;"That's a good idea, added a ticket:

shampine;t1;1600144825.0;r/technology;2020-09-15;04:40;Here ya go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfhYyTuT44
shampine;t1;1600125944.0;r/laravel;2020-09-14;23:25;"Not quite, this functions inside your MVC. Instead of having some controller method that looks like:


    function getUser($userId)
    {
       $user = $this-&gt;userService-&gt;getUser($userId);
       $notifications = $this-&gt;userService-&gt;getNotification($user-&gt;id);
       $messages = $this-&gt;userService-&gt;getMessages($user-&gt;id);
    
    
       return response()-&gt;json(
           [
             'user' =&gt; $user,
             'notifications' =&gt; $notifications,
             'messages' =&gt; $messages,
           ],
           200
        );
    }



We both know how this goes - the controller continues to get filled and filled with all this stuff. Eventually if/else statements come out and it becomes untestable and bugs start to pile up. So you abstract all these fetch calls into processes in a pipeline.

Using sequence

    function getUser($userId)
    {
        $payload = (new UserPayload())-&gt;setId($userId);
        $response = (new UserPipeline($userService))-&gt;process(Fetch', $payload)-&gt;format();
    
        return response()-&gt;json($response['data'], $response['status_code']);
    }
    
 the pipeline closure looks like

    self::SAMPLE_PIPELINE =&gt; static function() use ($userService) {
        return (new Pipeline)
            -&gt;pipe(new GetUser())
            -&gt;pipe(new GetNotifications())
            -&gt;pipe(new GetMessages())
            -&gt;pipe(new HydrateResponsePayloadProcess(UserResponse::class));
    }



Now adding some new features is as simple as adding another pipe (aka a process). Also you can reuse GetUser or the UserResponse payload or parts allow you the developer an easier time mixing and matching. 

i see so many Laravel applications with GIANT controllers and duplicate code everywhere. Using processes you can basically contain things into lego like blocks that you can plug into other pipelines where you need them. Allow insane amounts of code reuse. 

It's a much different way to address handling code in an MVC but has some great benefits."
shampine;t1;1600105574.0;r/laravel;2020-09-14;17:46;"I appreciate the feedback. Here's maybe a better tl;dr? The readme might contain too much sample code?

* Define a series of processes in a pipeline as a closure.
* Hydrate your Request class into a RequestPayload
* Pass the RequestPayload into the pipeline
* Return the response of the pipeline as json

Pipelines let you easily contain units of change into a process. You can then share processes with other pipelines. This allows easier code reuse and easier testing. It is not a standard pattern you see in an MVC framework.

Benefits of using PHP7, since there isn't any at all. Not sure why they even bothered updating the language.

- can handle more requests per second
- lower memory usage

- return types
- coalescing

Then you cannot use just gmail. You'll need a CRM integration with your email account. HubSpot CRM is free but I'm not sure about if you'll need to purchase something for integration.

I believe MailChimp still offers a free tier. You would use this to capture opt-ins for marketing emails and sending said marketing (bulk) emails.

Long term, by creating relevant content that your audience is looking for. This gets you ranking for these keywords without paying for the placement. 

Short term, search and display ads for relevant Google/Bing searches and audience placement. For example, is your audience mostly on Facebook, what are their interests, target that. What keywords would someone looking for service use, maybe they don't know about your service, what would they search when just getting started. Who are you trying to help.

- it normalizes the HTML for processing (pdf, spreadsheet, word documents, etc. are also converted to HTML for processing)

- it gets the content of the header tags and looks at the styling for the header tag to see the relative importance of the header tags

- it looks for some meta tags – robots meta tags, etc.

- collapsor – the system that’s doing error page handling tries to detect a page to see if it’s a 404 page, so if you have content that this system might mistake for an error page chances are they can not be indexed by Google. This system also has the potential to flag an out of stock product page on an e-commerce site as a soft 404 page depending on the words you use on the page."

Welcome to being a business owner. You're no longer just the do-er of things but you need to establish the business, market it, and nurture the growth. You can do this by growing your professional influence or building a company but either way you need to write down who your customer is and how you help them. Then start marketing.

&gt;Keep in mind that I need access to the tools, so when doing it, who provides that access? Or do you pay for it yourselves? Also, sometimes you need the credentials of the account, does the client provide them?

Depends on the situation. If the customer has an account, then they provide access or you include what you need in the service cost so you can have the tools you need."
JonODonovan;t1;1601066558.0;r/AskMarketing;2020-09-25;20:42;"You need to put yourself in your customer's shoes. Where would you then go to find a shop like yours? How would you search, what platforms would you expect to find shops, etc.

This is a great way to get subjective feedback which doesn't help anyone. 

I would take a deep look at your lead gen strategy. Are you targeting the right people, is the messaging right for them, and is the process to become a lead clear and without issue. 

You can evaluate your competitors sites and mark down what their process is from a visitor's point of view. What messaging are they using, is the process clear and without issue. 

Then if you're on par with them, you should take a closer look at what they're doing for lead gen, do they have paid ads, what language are they using, etc. 

You can't assume they're doing great with their process since you don't know but you can be critical of yours and their messaging and process, find common ground you think would resonate from a customer point of view and test."

This perception can be adjusted by communicating more. Weekly/monthly recap email to the company about new campaigns, how they're performing, impact to sales, and how they can participate (share/like) will allow the rest of the company to understand all the cool things marketing is doing, plus showase your hard work without directly stating it.

For the organization, it's probably best to invest in an actual project management platform. Or consolidate into one Excel sheet with multiple tabs. Having multiple places to look will add mental overhead when you're already so busy."

JonODonovan;t1;1596213763.0;r/advertising;2020-07-31;16:42;"&gt; This is a pretty good video, especially for folks not familiar with how Facebook ad targeting works. Overall, I'd say it was balanced and admits there's no explicit problem with how Facebook targets.

That's what I got out of it as well. If you're a noob and don't set audience targeting FB will do its best based on the ad content. 

I think the other angle they were pushing is gender bias stuff but I don't recall them outright saying it. Just like someone might profile based on what they experienced, the AI will profile based on the data and metrics it knows. And if that data is purposefully biased (from human intervention), then it's bad, I think that's what they were trying to get at."
JonODonovan;t1;1596209103.0;r/advertising;2020-07-31;15:25;"&gt;""It's their platform they can do whatever they want""

That the part I agree with. We're always at the mercy of the platforms. 

That's why best practice is to never build you're business based on the way things are. Cultivating your own/earned audience through your website and the data you collect on their habits is ideal."
JonODonovan;t1;1596208095.0;r/advertising;2020-07-31;15:08;"So then you understand that as an advertiser, if I do not select, in the example, male or female audience for a FB ad, in this case, they pick it for me. 

This is where the video is asking the question, is it okay that the AI segments automatically based on its percieved understanding of the content. I as an advertiser may want a muscle building dude ad to be shown equally to both sexes and not have FB automatically segment.

This shows that as advertisers, we need to been sure we're setting the audience segments correctly and hope that FB/others aren't interfering with it using AI.

It really is interesting as a marketer. How much control do we really think we have."

Depending on the size of the team, complexity of the sale, and many other factors - these are interesting areas for me (ex SVP Sales)...  


1. Stage progression analysis.  Who gets stuck where, how do we coach train around them, which types of markets warrant a different sales process?
2.  Sales call reluctance.  Consistent strategy for recognizing &amp; coaching around contributing patterns for poor performers and disengaged reps.  (Dudley &amp; Goodson, ""Psychology of Sales Call Reluctance"")
3. Optimal resource allocation.  There are supporting roles in a sales org (BDR, LG, Data, SE, etc) but at what ratios and which accounts/markets should they work, how does it drive a lower customer acquisition cost, higher velocity and customer lifetime value?  

All of this depends on the data in CRM, or at least ought to be.  You can read up on more in Challenger Sale, Top Dog, and research by TOPO (acquired by Gartner)."

I mod r/marketing (300k).  Although now in a different space, I spent over 10 years working with Infor (VISUAL+Syteline), MS Dynamics (AX, NAV) and Sage (MAS, ACCPAC). 

Mods ought to establish rules that the community can enforce when they are not present.  These rules ultimately result in better content.  Upvotes can't tell you if rules were followed.

r/ERP has become a cesspool of blogspam.  That's the first thing to go.  Everyone has a blog, some are even good, but most are thinly veiled promos answering a question that nobody asked.  There's a religious fervor about certain ERPs, but all of them are effective for the customers they service.  

This ought to be a hub of related ERP activity on Reddit, with AMAs from career implementation, operation and development people. 

People ought to be able to ask dumb questions,  through those questions you learn what content you must sticky/sidebar.  

Listening to ""actual"" users is a huge part of this, vendors have to be transparent, and people ought to out them for not disclosing.

Ban-deserving offenses ought to be limited to repeat breakers of rules.  So having rules is a good place to start."
