Yet today there is only oneâ\\x80\\x94homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more'}]"

Thereafter, we iterate over the list and add the current date time to it. Importantly, the `w` flag in the `with` statement indicates that the file will be overwritten every time the cell is executed. If you, however, want to append data to an existing file and avoid losing historical data, you can swap `w` for `a`. "

    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are ideal for combining programming and markdown (e.g., text, plots, equations), making it the default choice for sharing and presenting reproducible data analyses. Since we can execute code blocks one by one, it's suitable for developing and debugging code on the fly. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, Jupyter Notebooks also have some severe limitations when using them in production environments. That's where Spyder comes in, which is \"Integrated Development Environment\" (IDE). A fancy word, we know. So, let's revisit the most important differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the order in which you run cells within a notebook may affect the results. While prototyping, you may lose sight of the top-down hierarchy, which can cause problems once you restart the kernel (e.g., a library is imported after it is being used). Second, there is no easy way to browse through directories and files within a Jupyter Notebook. Third, notebooks cannot handle large codebases nor big data remarkably well. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we recommend starting in Jupyter Notebooks, moving code into functions along the way, and once all seems to be running well, copy-paste all necessary code into Spyder. From there, you can save it as a Python file (`.py`) - rather than a notebook (`.ipynb`) - and execute the file from the command line. Next, we introduce you to the Spyder IDE and learn how to run Python files from the command line. \n",
