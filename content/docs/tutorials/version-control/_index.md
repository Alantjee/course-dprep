# Tutorial: Version control

## Learning goals

* Set-up Git and GitHub
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow
* Restore to an earlier version using GitHub
* Collaborate on projects with others using Github
* Apply branching for experimentation and collaboration
* Work with large files on Github

## Getting Started

### Plan

- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

### Learn
- Develop your command line skills by completing the course [DataCamp Introduction to Shell](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell) (chapter 1). Mac users can opt to follow [this](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl) tutorial instead.

### Practice
- Learn the Git commands and apply the end-to-end Github in the following tutorial ([View](version-control.html)). 

- If you like, you can submit your exercises as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment). Note that this time there's no skeleton file as most exercises are done in the terminal. Therefore, we ask you to submit a link to your personal Github repository (e.g., `version-control-exercises`) in which you have completed the set of exercises.


### Create
- T.B.D.
