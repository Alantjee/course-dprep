# Tutorial: Version control

## Learning goals

* Set-up Git and GitHub
* Apply the end-to-end Git workflow
* Restore to an earlier version using GitHub
* Collaborate on projects with others using Github
* Apply branching for experimentation and collaboration
* Work with large files on Github

## Getting Started

### Plan

- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

### Learn
- Develop your command line skills by completing the course [DataCamp Introduction to Shell](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell) (chapter 1). Mac users can opt to follow [this](https://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl) tutorial instead.

### Practice
- Learn the Git commands and apply the end-to-end Github in the following tutorial ([View](version-control.html)). 

- If you like, you can submit your exercises as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment). Note that this time there's no skeleton file as most exercises are done in the terminal. Therefore, we ask you to submit a link to your personal Github repository (e.g., `version-control-exercises`) in which you have completed the set of exercises.


### Create
In the tutorial above, you already practised forking a repository. In this section, we ask you to put all your Git skills to the test by following an end-to-end workflow. The idea is that we ask you to contribute the [course website](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com) (which can be as little as fixing a typo) through a pull request. Below are some instructions to help you get started: 

1. Install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (if you didn't do that already)
2. Fork [course repository](https://github.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep)
3. Clone your own fork to the disk
4. Run `hugo server` and see the site as is
5. Branch out (`git branch newfeature`)
6. Work on a new feature, e.g., correction of typo, content, etc.)
7. Push changes locally
8. When happy, issue a pull request from the website (please give a brief description of your changes)
