# Tutorial: Data preparation in R


## Learning goals

* Merge data sets on one or more indices and understand the different types of joins (inner, left, right join)
* Handle and preprocess string data (remove characters, splitting)
* Apply a variety of feature engineering techniques (grouping, rank, counter)
* Document code and analyses with an R Markdown


## Getting started

### Plan
- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

### Learn
- Develop your R skills by completing the DataCamp courses [DataCamp Introduction to Tidyverse](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse/data-wrangling-1?ex=1) (chapter 1 and 3), [DataCamp Cleaning Data in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-r) (chapter 1 and 2), and [DataCamp Joining Data with dplyr](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-with-dplyr/joining-tables-1) (chapter 1 and 2).

### Practice
- Practice some more by preparing a new dataset with R for futher analysis ([View](data-preparation.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-preparation-skeleton.Rmd))
- If you like, you can submit your exercises as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment). Work on the exercises in the answer skeleton file ([Download](data-preparation-skeleton.Rmd); right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in RStudio.

### Create (Data Challenge #2)
- Create an RMarkdown report in which you explore open-ended questions! Start from the answer skeleton ([View](data-report.html), [Download; right click - download file as](data-report.Rmd))
- If you like, you can submit your data challenge as a "proof for investing in your skills" (self- and peer assessment).
