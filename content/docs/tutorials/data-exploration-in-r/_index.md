# Tutorial: Data exploration in R

## Learning goals

* Explore data sets in R
  * Read data from text files into data frames in R
  * Create and handle various data types in R (e.g., vector, matrix, dataframe)
  * Change the content of data frames (e.g., create, drop, or rename columns)
  * Filter data in data frames (e.g., by index, logical expressions, missing records, etc.)
  * Apply basic programming concepts (if-else statements, for-loop, functions )
* Assess data quality and obtain an understanding about the data
  * Calculate with data (e.g., summing up numbers)
  * Generate summary statistics
  * Generate plots

## Make a plan
- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

<!--* Analyze data (summary statistics, mathematical operations, sort data, plots)-->

## Getting started

### 1) Develop your R skills
* [DataCamp Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (chapters 1-4; 5 is optional)

### 2) Work on Data Challenge #1
- View the [Data exploration in R - Data Challenge](intro-to-r.html)
- Download the answer skeleton [file](intro-to-r-skeleton.R) (right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in RStudio, fill out your answers and submit your work!
