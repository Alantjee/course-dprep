# Tutorial: Data exploration in R

## Learning goals

- Setup R and R Studio
- Explore data sets in R
  - Read data from text files into data frames in R
  - Create and handle various data types in R (e.g., vector, matrix, dataframe)
  - Change the content of data frames (e.g., create, drop, or rename columns)
  - Filter data in data frames (e.g., by index, logical expressions, missing records, etc.)
  - Apply basic programming concepts (if-else statements, for-loop, functions )
- Assess data quality and obtain an understanding about the data
  - Calculate with data (e.g., taking an average)
  - Generate summary statistics (e.g., using `summary()` and `table()`)
  - Generate plots (e.g., using `plot()`)
  - Produce an RMarkdown document (HTML, PDF)

## Make a plan
- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

<!--* Analyze data (summary statistics, mathematical operations, sort data, plots)-->

## Getting started

### 1) Develop your R skills
* [DataCamp Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (about 4-6 hours)

### 2) Work on Data Challenge #1
- View or download Data exploration in R - Data Challenge ([View](intro-to-r.html), [Download (right click - download file as)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hannesdatta/course-dprep/master/content/docs/tutorials/data-exploration-in-r/intro-to-r.Rmd))

- [Download the answer skeleton file](intro-to-r-skeleton.Rmd) (right-click, download linked file as...). Then, open the file in RStudio, fill out your answers and submit your work on Canvas.
