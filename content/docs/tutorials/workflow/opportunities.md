# Opportunity Identification

## For Academics


It may sound simple, but it is actually not. How to identify an opportunity for scraping data? Unlike what many researchers think, you don't really have to have a research question ready to get started. Sometimes, a mere feeling for a hot data context may be enough to warrant investigating scraping the data.

__How attending a party in Hamburg led to a [publication on music streaming](https://tiu.nu/spotify)__

For example, long before online music streaming was the default, I met a friend's friend at a house party, who told me about this fantastic app called Spotify, which had just launched in The Netherlands at the time. I was amazed by the amount of new music I discovered when using the app. I also noticed my music taste was slowly gravitating from rock music to electronic dance, and - as a researcher - I wondered why? So, I decided to look for data that tracks users' digital music consumption on the web, so that I could study that behavior later.

When browsing the web, I found that amazing social network for music - it's been around for ages, long before Spotify came into existence. That website provided an API which allowed me to extract users' consumption histories. [Check out the website](https://last.fm) and its [API](https://last.fm/api)!

Rather than a mere gut feeling, researchers may also have specific goals on their mind to improve the relevance or rigor of their research. For example, including data collected from the web in one's study allows researchers to __observe real-world behavior__. Such behavioral data may complement experimental data, and hence improve the external validity of their research. Also, data collected via web scraping or APIs allows researchers to __increase the timeliness of their work__. Researchers that use data collected via web scraping can capture information that otherwise has not been structured or observed yet by commercial data suppliers.

## For Business

Web scraping is also a technique that's commonly used to retrieve data for business purposes. For example, the business model of search engines heavily hinges on two things: great algorithms to crunch large amounts of data, and *data collected via web scraping* - namely data on what's on the internet. Web scrapers that index the web are commonly referred to as "bots" or "web crawlers", or "web spiders", automatically visit sites as they encounter new links, and store this information in a large database.

Today, the business model of many firms hinges on web scraping. For example, businesses monitor prices and share those with firms (see, e.g., the Dutch firm [InPrijsVerhoogd](https://www.ipvdata.com/en/) and consumers (see, e.g., [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.com)), or gather data on the social media performance of influencers (see, e.g., [SocialBlade](https://socialblade.com) or music artists (see, e.g., [Chartmetric](https://chartmetric.com).

As APIs are a more official way to exchange data with partners, many firms use APIs to exchange data or provide functionality. For example, the API of financial service provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com) allows developers to add payment functionality to their services.

Finally, note that web scraping and APIs can be used for retrieving *and* posting data. For example, firms have employed scraping to transfer data from old systems to new databases. In essence, that entails the firm scraping their own data, and making it more usuable in one way or another.
