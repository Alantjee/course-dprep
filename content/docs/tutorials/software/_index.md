# Software installation

## Learning goals

- Set up your computer for conducting web scraping in Python
  - Install Anaconda/Python 3
  - Install Chrome
  - Install chromedriver and configure environment variables
- Understand the need for a local setup (vis-a-vis a cloud-based setup, which we strongly disadvise for this class)
- Get introduced to Jupyter Notebook and Spyder
  - Learn various ways to launch Jupyter Notebook and Spyder (command prompt, Navigator), and implications for the current working directory
  - Learn about the differences between Jupyter Notebook and Spyder, and when to use what
  - Jupyter Notebook specifics: Learn about markdown cells vs. code cells, and how to execute those
  - Spyder specifics: Code execution
  - Open files downloaded from the internet (e.g., `.ipynb`, `.py`)
- Enable you to have the software setup right to follow basic tutorials in Python,


## Getting started
- Access to a computer with administrator rights (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- We strongly advise not to use Chromebooks (Android)
- [Install Anaconda](anaconda.md)
- [Familiarize yourself with Jupyter Notebook](jupyter.md)
