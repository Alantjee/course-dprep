# Tutorial: Pipeline building and automation


## Learning goals

* Learn how to organize and track the evolution of your projects
* Automate workflows and make them reproducible using `make`
* Documenting Source Code and Pipeline workflows
* Describe raw data using a template

## Getting Started

#### Plan
- Plan a full day to work through this tutorial.

### Learn

- Watch the introductory video [Pipeline building and automation in make](LINK_VIDEO)
- Study the lecture notes on [Automating Your Pipeline](https://tsh-website.netlify.app/tutorials/project-setup/principles-of-project-setup-and-workflow-management/automation/)
- Revisit the [slidedeck](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC-original-website/tree/master/automation01_slides)


### Practice
- Practice some more by going over the [workflow](https://tsh-website.netlify.app/tutorials/more-tutorials/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow-overview/) tutorial. As you'll see, it involves a blend of R and Python code. If you're taking oDCM in parallel to this class, Python should be familiar to you. If not, don't worry just follow the set-up instructions to install Python and the `textblob` module on your machine. The purpose of the tutorial is not to turn you into a Python wizard, but rather to illustrate the value of make in a data pipeline. The fact that you can use both R and Python only makes it more powerful!


### Create
- In the live session of this week, we'll see how we can quickly make changes to the workflow (e.g., swapping around files and directories) without breaking the pipeline. Make sure to fully understand the details of the practise [workflow](https://tsh-website.netlify.app/tutorials/more-tutorials/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow/implement-an-efficient-and-reproducible-workflow-overview/), to get most out of this session!
